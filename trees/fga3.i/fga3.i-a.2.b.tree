    Let #{\mathcal{C}} be the category of preschemes.
    Let #{S\in\mathcal{C}}, and let #{S'} and #{S''} be preschemes that are \em{finite} over #{S}, i.e. that correspond to sheaves of algebras #{\sh{A}'} and #{\sh{A}''} over #{S} that are quasi-coherent (as sheaves of modules) and of finite type (i.e. coherent, if #{S} is locally Noetherian).
    Let #{\alpha\colon S'\to S} be the structure morphism of #{S'}, and let #{\beta_1} and #{\beta_2} be #{S}-morphisms from #{S''} to #{S'}, defined by algebra homomorphisms #{\sh{A}'\to\sh{A}''}, which we also denote by #{\beta_1} and #{\beta_2}.
    Using the fact that a finite morphism is closed (the first Cohenâ€“Seidenberg theorem), we can easily prove that the diagram in #{\mathcal{C}}

      \sh{O}_S = \sh{A} \xrightarrow{\alpha}
      \sh{A}' \ourrar{\beta_1}{\beta_2}
      \sh{A}''
    }
    is exact.
    In particular, if #{\alpha\colon S'\to S} is a finite morphism corresponding to a sheaf #{\sh{A}'} of algebras on #{S}, then #{\alpha} is a strict epimorphism if and only if the diagram of sheaves
    ##{
      \sh{O}_S = \sh{A} \to
      \sh{A}' \ourrar{p_1}{p_2}
      \sh{A}'\otimes_{\sh{A}}\sh{A}'
    }
    is exact (it is an epimorphism if and only if #{\sh{A}\to\sh{A}'} is injective).
    If #{S} is affine of ring #{A}, then #{S'} is affine of ring #{A'}, with #{A'} finite over #{A}, and so #{S'\to S} is a strict epimorphism if and only if #{A\to A'} is an isomorphism from #{A} to the subring of #{A'} consisting of the #{x'\in A'} such that
    ##{
      1_{A'}\otimes_A x' - x'\otimes_A 1_{A'}
      = 0
    }
    (it is an epimorphism if and only if #{A\to A'} is injective).
    As we have already mentioned, even if #{S} is the scheme of a local Artinian ring, then a finite morphism #{S'\to S} that is an epimorphism is not necessarily a strict epimorphism.
    However, we can prove that, \em{if #{S} is a Noetherian prescheme, then every finite morphism #{S'\to S} that is an epimorphism is the composition of a finite sequence of strict epimorphisms} (also finite).
    This also shows that the composition of two strict epimorphisms is not necessarily a strict epimorphism.
