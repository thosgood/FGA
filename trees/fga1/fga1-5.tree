\p{
  In this section, #{X} denotes a non-singular projective variety of dimension #{n}.
}

\subtree[fga1-theorem-2]{
  \taxon{theorem}
  \number{2}

  \p{
    The fundamental class #{\varepsilon_X} of #{\HH^n(X,\Omega_X^n)} is a basis of this vector space.
  }

  \proof{
    \p{
      The proof of this statement will be given later on.
    }
  }
}

\p{
  With the above theorem, we can thus identify #{\HH^n(X,\Omega_X^n)} with the field #{k}.
  \oldpage{149-14}
  We now consider the pairings described in \ref{fga1-2}, which give, in particular, a pairing
  ##{
    \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^p(X;\sh{O}_X,\sh{F})\times\Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^{n-p}(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n)
    \to \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^n(X;\sh{O}_X,\Omega_X^n)
  }
  i.e.

  \subtree[fga1-equation-5.1]{
    \taxon{equation}
    \number{5.1}
    ##{
      \HH^p(X,\sh{F})\times\Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^{n-p}(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n)
      \to \HH^n(X,\Omega_X^n).
    \startverb\tag{5.1}\stopverb
    }
  }

  Taking \ref{fga1-theorem-2} into account, this pairing defines a homomorphism

  \subtree[fga1-equation-5.2]{
    \taxon{equation}
    \number{5.2}
    ##{
      \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^{n-p}(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n)
      \to (\HH^p(X,\sh{F}))'.
    \startverb\tag{5.2}\stopverb
    }
  }

  This homomorphism is functorial in #{\sh{F}}, and commutes with the coboundary maps relative to the exact sequences #{0\to\sh{F}'\to\sh{F}\to\sh{F}''\to0}.
}

\subtree[fga1-theorem-3]{
  \taxon{theorem}
  \number{3}

  \p{
    The homomorphism in \ref{fga1-equation-5.2} is an isomorphism.
  }
}

\p{
  In particular, we recover the following result of Serre:
}

\subtree[fga1-theorem-3-corollary]{
  \taxon{corollary}

  \p{
    Let #{E} be an algebraic vector bundle on #{X}, and #{\sh{O}_X(E)} the sheaf of germs of regular sections of #{X}.
    Then we have canonical isomorphisms
    \note{This equation is labelled (5.3) in the original copy of the notes, but this seems to be a typo, since a later equation shares the same number, and any references to (5.3) seem to indeed point to the later equation instead of this one.}
    ##{
      (\HH^p(X,\sh{O}_X(E)))'
      = \HH^{n-p}(X,\Omega_X^n\otimes\sh{O}_X(E')).
    }
  }

  \proof{
    \p{
      It suffices to apply \ref{fga1-theorem-3} and [Corollary 1 of Proposition 1](fga1-proposition-1-corollary-1).
    }
  }
}

\p{
  \ref{fga1-theorem-2} and \ref{fga1-theorem-3} will follow from the following claim:
}

\subtree[fga1-d]{
  \taxon{statement}
  \number{D}

  \p{
    The homomorphism
    \subtree[fga1-equation-5.2bis]{
      \taxon{equation}
      \number{5.2 bis}
      ##{
        \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^{n-p}(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n)
        \to (\HH^p(X,\sh{F}))'\otimes\sh{L}
      \startverb\tag{5.2 bis}\stopverb
      }
    }

    (where #{\sh{L}=\HH^n(X,\Omega_X^n)}) induced by the pairing in \ref{fga1-equation-5.1} is an isomorphism.
  }
}

\p{
  We will show that \ref{fga1-d} implies \ref{fga1-theorem-2}.
  Let #{k_x=\sh{O}_{(x)}} be the structure sheaf of the variety consisting of a single point #{x\in X}, and consider the canonical homomorphism #{\sh{O}_X\to k_x}, and the associated homomorphism

  \subtree[fga1-equation-5.3]{
    \taxon{equation}
    \number{5.3}

      \HH^0(X,\sh{O}_X) \to \HH^0(X,k_x).

  }

  Its transpose can be identified with the homomorphism

  \subtree[fga1-equation-5.4]{
    \taxon{equation}
    \number{5.4}
    ##{
      \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^n(X;k_x,\Omega_X^n)\otimes\sh{L}' \to \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^n(X;\sh{O}_X,\Omega_X^n)\otimes\sh{L}'

  induced by the homomorphism between the #{\Ext^n} associated to #{\sh{O}_X\to k_x}, i.e.

      \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^n(X;k_x,\Omega_X^n)

    }
  }

  \oldpage{149-15}
  Since \ref{fga1-equation-5.3} is an isomorphism, so too is \ref{fga1-equation-5.4}, and thus so too is \ref{fga1-equation-5.5}.
  Since #{s_{(x)}} is a basis of #{\Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^n(X;k_x,\Omega_X^n)} by \ref{fga1-equation-4.2}, it indeed follows that its image #{\varepsilon_X} is a basis of #{\HH^n(X,\Omega_X^n)}.
}

\p{
  It remains only to prove \ref{fga1-d}, which will follow in a purely formal way from some elementary facts summarised in the following lemmas.
  Here we suppose that #{X} is a closed subset (singular or not) of the projective space #{\bb{P}} of dimension #{r}.
  We use the notation #{\sh{O}_\bb{P}(m)} to denote the sheaf on #{\bb{P}} denoted by #{\sh{O}(m)} in [@Ser1955], and the notation #{\sh{O}_X(m)} for the analogous sheaf on #{X}.
}

\subtree[fga1-lemma-2]{
  \taxon{lemma}
  \number{2}

  \p{
    The statement of \ref{fga1-d} is true if #{X=\bb{P}} and #{\sh{F}=\sh{O}_\bb{P}(m)}.
  }

  \proof{
    \p{
      This lemma can be proved by a direct calculation.
      The explicit calculation of the #{\HH^i(\bb{P},\sh{O}_\bb{P}(m))} can be found in [@Ser1955], but it also can be done in a simpler way.
      Computing the cup product #{\HH^i(\bb{P},\sh{O}_\bb{P}(m))\times\HH^j(\bb{P},\sh{O}_\bb{P}(m)') \to \HH^{i+j}(\bb{P},\sh{O}_\bb{P}(m+m'))} (which is necessary to calculate the pairing in \ref{fga1-equation-5.1}) does not present any difficulty.
    }
  }
}

\subtree[fga1-lemma-3]{
  \taxon{lemma}
  \number{3}

  \p{
    Every coherent algebraic sheaf #{\sh{F}} on #{X} is isomorphic to a sheaf that is some quotient of #{\sh{O}_X(-m)^k}, and we can take #{m} to be as large as we wish.
  }

  \proof{
    \p{
      This follows from the fact that #{\sh{F}\otimes\sh{O}_X(m)} is "generated by its sections" for large enough #{m};
      see [@Ser1955].
    }
  }
}

\subtree[fga1-lemma-4]{
  \taxon{lemma}
  \number{4}

  \p{
    Let #{i>0}.
    Then #{\HH^{r-i}(\bb{P},\sh{O}_\bb{P}(-m))=0} for large enough #{m};
    and, for every coherent algebra sheaf #{\sh{B}} on #{X}, we have that #{\Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^i(X;\sh{O}_X(-m),\sh{B})=0} for large enough #{m}.
  }

  \proof{
    \p{
      The first claim follows from the explicit calculations mentioned above;
      for the second, we note that we have an isomorphism
      ##{
        \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^i(X;\sh{O}_X(-m),\sh{B})
        = \HH^i(X,\sh{B}\otimes\sh{O}(m))
      }
      (by [Corollary 1 of Proposition 1](fga1-proposition-1-corollary-1)), whence the conclusion, by a well-known result of [@Ser1955].
    }
  }
}

\p{
  Combining the previous two lemmas, we find:
}

\subtree[fga1-lemma-3-and-4-corollary]{
  \taxon{corollary}

  \p{
    Let #{i>0}.
    Then the functor #{\sh{F}\mapsto\HH^{r-i}(\bb{P},\sh{F})} on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on #{\bb{P}} is coeffaceable, and so too is the functor #{\Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^i(X;\sh{F},\sh{B})} on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on #{X}.
  }
}

\subtree[fga1-lemma-5]{
  \taxon{lemma}
  \number{5}

  \p{
    \oldpage{149-16}
    Let #{\sh{A}} and #{\sh{B}} be coherent algebraic sheaves on #{X}, and let #{\sh{A}(m)=\sh{A}\otimes\sh{O}_X(m)}.
    Then, for large enough #{m}, the canonical homomorphism
    ##{
      \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^i(X;\sh{A}(-m),\sh{B})
      \to \HH^0(X,\shExt_{\sh{O}_X}^i(\sh{A}(-m),\sh{B}))
      = \HH^0(X,\shExt_{\sh{O}_X}^i(\sh{A},\sh{B})(m))
    }
    is an isomorphism.
  }

  \proof{
    \p{
      This follows immediately from the spectral sequence in \ref{fga1-proposition-1} applied to #{\sh{A}(-m)} and #{\sh{B}}, since we then have that
      ##{
        E_2^{p,q}(\sh{A}(-m),\sh{B})
        = \HH^p(X,\shExt_{\sh{O}_X}^q(\sh{A}(-m),\sh{B}))
        = \HH^p(X,\shExt_{\sh{O}_X}^q(\sh{A},\sh{B})(m))
      }
      which is zero for #{p>0} and large enough #{m}.
    }
  }
}

\p{
  We now prove \ref{fga1-d} in the case where #{X=\bb{P}}.
  We will first prove that \ref{fga1-equation-5.2bis} is an isomorphism for #{p=n};
  since both sides are then left-exact functors (since #{\HH^{r+i}(\bb{P},\sh{F})=0}), it follows from \ref{fga1-lemma-3} that it suffices to prove the claim for #{\sh{F}=\sh{O}_\bb{P}(-m)}, but this is covered by \ref{fga1-lemma-2}.
  Since the homomorphisms in \ref{fga1-equation-5.2bis} are functorial and compatible with the coboundary maps, and since, for #{p<n}, both sides of \ref{fga1-equation-5.2bis} are coeffaceable functors in #{\sh{F}} (the [corollary to Lemmas 3 and 4](fga1-lemma-3-and-lemma-4-corollary)), it follows, by a standard argument, that \ref{fga1-equation-5.2bis} is an isomorphism for all #{p}.
  This proves the duality theorem for the projective space.
}

\p{
  Now suppose that #{X} is arbitrary, but non-singular.
  By the duality theorem for #{\bb{P}}, we have an isomorphism
  ##{
    \HH^n(X,\sh{F})
    = \HH^n(\bb{P},\sh{F})'
    = \Ext_{\sh{O}_\bb{P}}^{r-n}(\bb{P};\sh{F},\Omega_\bb{P}^r).
  }
  By \ref{fga1-lemma-1}, the far-right-hand side can be identified with
  ##{
    \Hom_{\sh{O}_\bb{P}}(\bb{P};\sh{F},\omega_X^n)
    = \Hom_{\sh{O}_X}(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n)
    = \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^0(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n)
  }
  whence we have an isomorphism

  \subtree[fga1-equation-5.6]{
    \taxon{equation}
    \number{5.6}
    ##{
      \HH^n(X,\sh{F})'
      = \Hom_{\sh{O}_X}(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n)
      = \Ext_{\sh{O}_X}^0(X;\sh{F},\Omega_X^n).
    \startverb\tag{5.6}\stopverb
    }
  }

  Taking #{\sh{F}=\Omega_X^n}, we obtain an isomorphism

  \subtree[fga1-equation-5.7]{
    \taxon{equation}
    \number{5.7}
    ##{
      \eta\colon \HH^n(X,\Omega_X^n) \xrightarrow{\sim} k.
    \startverb\tag{5.7}\stopverb
    }
  }

  \oldpage{149-17}
  We can prove that the isomorphism in \ref{fga1-equation-5.6} is exactly \ref{fga1-equation-5.2bis} with #{p=n} and #{\sh{L}=k}, by \ref{fga1-equation-5.7}.
  Subsequently, \ref{fga1-equation-5.2bis} is an isomorphism for #{p=n}.
  To prove that it is an isomorphism for all #{p}, it again suffices to prove that, for #{p<n}, the two sides of \ref{fga1-equation-5.2bis} are coeffaceable functors in #{\sh{F}}, and, a fortiori (taking \ref{fga1-lemma-3} into account), that the two sides are zero when we take #{\sh{F}=\sh{O}_X(-m)} with large enough #{m}.
  But, for the left-hand side, this is true by \ref{fga1-lemma-4}, and for the right-hand side we can write, using the duality theorem for #{\bb{P}},
  ##{
    \HH^p(X,\sh{O}_X(-m))'
    = \Ext_{\sh{O}_\bb{P}}^{r-p}(\bb{P};\sh{O}_X(-m),\Omega_\bb{P}^r).
  }
  The right-hand side is zero for #{p<n} and large enough #{m}, as follows from \ref{fga1-lemma-5} (where in fact #{X=\bb{P}}) and from the fact that #{\sh{O}_X} is of cohomological dimension #{\leq r-n} when thought of as a coherent algebraic sheaf on #{\bb{P}} (since #{X} is non-singular), whence
  ##{
    \shExt_{\sh{O}_\bb{P}}^{r-p}(\sh{O}_X,\Omega_\bb{P}^r)
    = 0
    \quad\text{for }p<n.
  }
}
