    Let #{S} be a \em{locally Noetherian} prescheme, #{X} a \em{quasi-projective} #{S}-scheme, and #{\mathcal{R}} an equivalence pre-relation on #{X}, such that:
    \todo{the following list should be a, b}

    \ol{
      \li{
        #{p_1\colon R_1\to X} is proper and flat; and
      }

      \li{
        #{R_1\to X\times_S X} is a finite morphism (or, equivalently, by (a), a morphism with finite fibres, which is a condition that is automatically satisfied if #{\mathcal{R}} comes from an equivalence relation).
      }
    }

    Under these conditions:
    \todo{the following list should be i, ii, etc.}

    \ol{
      \li{
        #{Y=X/\mathcal{R}} exists, and (if #{S} is Noetherian) is quasi-projective over #{S}.
        \note{\comp The fact that #{Y=X/\mathcal{R}} is quasi-projective over #{S} has only been proven, for now, in the case where #{\mathcal{R}} comes from an equivalence relation.}
      }

      \li{
        The canonical morphism #{f\colon X\to Y} is surjective, proper, and open, and its fibres are the equivalence classes #{p_2(p_1^{-1}(x))} in #{X} modulo #{\mathcal{R}}, and so #{Y} can be identified with the topological quotient space of #{X} by the set-theoretic equivalence relation defined by #{\mathcal{R}}.
        Finally, #{R_1\to X\times_Y X} is surjective.
      }

      \li{
        If #{\mathcal{R}} comes from an equivalence relation, then the equivalence relation in question is effective, i.e. #{R_1\to X\times_Y X} is an isomorphism, and, further, #{f\colon X\to Y} is flat (and thus faithfully flat).
      }
    }
  }

  \proof{
    \p{
      For the proof, we can reduce to \ref{fga3.iii-5-theorem-5.1} by considering suitable quasi-sections of #{X} for #{\mathcal{R}}, with the proof being analogous to the construction of algebraic quotient groups in the \em{SÃ©minaire Chevalley}.

  \p{
    Let #{X} be quasi-projective over #{S}, with #{S} locally Noetherian.
    Then the data of a proper, faithfully flat, and surjective morphism #{f\colon X\to Y} from #{X} to an #{S}-prescheme #{Y} is equivalent to the data of an equivalence relation #{R} on #{X} such that #{p_1\colon R\to X} is proper and flat.

  \p{
    Let #{S} be a Noetherian prescheme, #{X} a prescheme of finite type over #{S}, and #{\mathcal{R}} an equivalence pre-relation on the #{S}-prescheme #{X}.
    Suppose that
    \todo{the following list should be a, b}

    \ol{
      \li{
        #{p_1\colon R_1\to X} is flat and of finite type; and
      }
      \li{
        the morphism #{R_1\to X\times_S X} is quasi-finite (i.e. has finite fibres).
      }
    }

    Then there exists a \em{dense} open subset #{U} of #{X} that is \em{saturated} for #{\mathcal{R}}, such that:
    \todo{the following list should be i, ii, etc.}

    \ol{
      \li{
        If #{\mathcal{R}_U} is the equivalence pre-relation induced by #{\mathcal{R}} on #{U}, then #{U/\mathcal{R}_U} exists, and is of finite type over #{S}.
      }

      \li{
        The canonical morphism #{U\to U/\mathcal{R}_U} is surjective and open, and its fibres are the set-theoretic equivalence classes for #{\mathcal{R}_U} (and thus #{U/\mathcal{R}_U} is a topological quotient space of #{U} by the set-theoretic equivalence relation defined by #{\mathcal{R}_U}).
        Finally, the morphism #{(\mathcal{R}_U)_1\to U\times_{U/\mathcal{R}_U}U} is surjective.
      }

      \li{
        If #{\mathcal{R}} comes from an equivalence relation, then we can suppose that #{U\to U/\mathcal{R}_U} is faithfully flat and that #{\mathcal{R}_U} is effective.
      }
    }

  This is a result of an essentially "birational" nature.

  \ol{
    \li{
      I do not know if, in \ref{fga3.iii-6-theorem-6.1} and \ref{fga3.iii-6-theorem-6.2}, hypothesis (b) is useless.
      In practice, it obliges us, in the passage to the quotient by groups, to restrict to he case where the stabilisers are all finite groups.
    }

    \li{
      We can ask if there are results analogous to \ref{fga3.iii-6-theorem-6.1} and \ref{fga3.iii-6-theorem-6.2} without any flatness hypothesis.
      I have no counter example in this direction.
      However, even keeping the flatness hypothesis, and restricting to equivalence relations such that #{p_1\colon R\to X} is flat and quasi-finite (but not finite), and with #{X} affine, it can still be the case that #{R} is not effective: take the equivalence relations induced on the affine open subsets covering the Nagata variety (or a group with two elements acting in a "non-admissible" way).
