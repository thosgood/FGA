# Foundations of Algebraic Geometry

[![Bookdown](https://github.com/thosgood/fga/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thosgood/fga/actions/workflows/main.yml)

An English translation of Grothendieck's Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique.
The original notes have been scanned and uploaded by the Grothendieck Circle [here](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/FGA.pdf).

## To-do

- pdf output
- fix other citations to the Mumford--Tate seminar
- pdf specific definitions (e.g. `\ourrar`, `\oullar`, `\simto`, `\simfrom`)
- turn any FGA citations into links?
    + (including those that are citations to the FGAs in the bibliography?)
    + **probably best to remove FGA from the bibliography entirely tbh and replace inline citations with "FGA X.Y, Z"**
- generally check that citations are "correct"
    + e.g. the first citation in §1.1 of FGA 1 says `[6 and 4]` instead of `[6, chaps. 3 and 4]`
- move all custom commands to `index.Rmd`?
- move all `\oldpage` commands into the starts of lines
- consistent choice between empty lines between i. and ii. or not
- (margin/padding)-top of lists in `.itenv` (seems like there's none?)
- bring over menu bar from qubit.guide? new github source icon etc.
