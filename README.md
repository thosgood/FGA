# Foundations of Algebraic Geometry

[![Bookdown](https://github.com/thosgood/fga/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thosgood/fga/actions/workflows/main.yml)

An English translation of Grothendieck's Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique.
The original notes have been scanned and uploaded by the Grothendieck Circle [here](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/FGA.pdf).

## To-do

- `GIT_COMMIT_HASH_VARIABLE`
- pdf output
- pdf specific definitions (e.g. `\ourrar`, `\oullar`, `\simto`, `\simfrom`)
- why is there no date for so many things in the bib?
- turn any FGA citations into links
    + (including those that are citations to the FGAs in the bibliography?)
- consistent choice between empty lines between i. and ii. or not
- margin/padding -top of lists in `.itenv` (seems like there's none?)
- make sepia colour scheme not look so gross
    + TOC and Font Settings
    + links
