## Introduction {-}

\oldpage{221-01}

The techniques described in [@3-IV-2, I and II] were, for the most part, independent of any projective hypotheses on the schemes in question.
Unfortunately, they have not as of yet allowed us to solve the existence problems posed in [@3-IV-2, II].
In the current exposé, and the following, we will solve these problems by imposing projective hypotheses.
The techniques used are typically projective, and practically make no use of any results from [@3-IV-2, I and II].
Here we will construct "Hilbert schemes", which are meant to replace the use of Chow coordinates, as was mentioned in [@3-IV-2, II, §2].
In the next exposé, the theory of passing to the quotient in schemes, developed in [@3-IV-2, III], combined with the theory of Hilbert schemes, will allow us, for example, to construct Picard schemes (defined in [@3-IV-2, II, §3]) under rather general conditions.

In summary, we can say that we now have a more or less satisfying technique of projective constructions, apart from the fact that we are still missing^[See the addendum at the end of this exposé.] a theory of passing to the quotient by groups such as the projective group, acting "without fixed points" (cf. [@3-IV-2, III, §8]).
The situation even seems slightly better in analytic geometry (if we restrict to the study of "projective" analytic spaces over a given analytic space), since, for analytic spaces, the difficulty of passing to the quotient by a group that acts nicely disappears.
Either way, in algebraic geometry, as well as in analytic geometry, it remains to develop a construction technique that works without any projective hypotheses.


## Bounded sets of sheaves: invariance properties {#FGA-3-IV-section-1}

Let $k$ be a field, and $X$ a $k$-prescheme (which we take to be of finite type, for simplicity).
For every extension $K/k$, we obtain a $K$-prescheme $X_K=X\otimes_k K$.
If $\scr{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on $X_K$, and if $K'$ is an extension of $K$, then $\scr{F}\otimes_K K'=\scr{F}_{K'}$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X_K\otimes_KK'=X_{K'}$.
So, if $K$ and $K'$ are arbitrary extensions of $k$, and $\scr{F}$ a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X_K$ and $\scr{F}'$
\oldpage{221-02}
a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X_{K'}$, then we say that $\scr{F}$ and $\scr{F}'$ are _equivalent_ if there exists an extension $K"/k$ as well as $k$-homomorphisms $K\to K"$ and $K'\to K"$ such that $\scr{F}_{K"}$ and $\scr{F}'_{K"}$ are isomorphic on $X_{K"}$ **(TO-DO: ? is this right?)**.
This defines an equivalence relation, and we are interested in the equivalence classes of sheaves under this relation, and of sets of such equivalence classes.
Note that, if $X_0$ is of finite type over $k$, then every class of coherent sheaves can be defined by a coherent sheaf on $X_K$, where $K$ is some extension of $k$ _of finite type_.
We can thus, in the definition of classes of coherent sheaves, restrict ourselves to _algebraically closed_ extensions of $k$, and we can also restrict ourselves to a fixed algebraically closed extension $\Omega$ of $k$, of infinite transcendence degree;
two coherent sheaves $\scr{F}$ and $\scr{F}'$ on $X_\Omega$ are then equivalent if and only if there exists a $K$-automorphism $\sigma$ of $\Omega$ such that $\scr{F}\otimes_K(\Omega,\sigma)$ is isomorphic to $\scr{F}'$.
Note that there is a bijective correspondence between classes of coherent sheaves under the first definition and under the second.

Let $E$ and $E'$ be two sets of classes of coherent sheaves on $X$.
Consider the classes of all sheaves of the form $\scr{F}\otimes\scr{F}'$, where $\scr{F}$ and $\scr{F}'$ are coherent sheaves on the _same_ $X_K$, with the class of $\scr{F}$ being in $E$ and the class of $\scr{F}'$ being in $E'$.
We thus define a set of classes of coherent sheaves that we denote by $E\otimes E'$.
We can similarly define $\shTor_i(E,E')$, etc.
