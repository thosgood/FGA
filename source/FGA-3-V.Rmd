## Relative Picard groups and functors {#fga-3-v-section-1}

\oldpage{232-01}
For every prescheme (more generally, every ringed space) $X$, we define the (*absolute*) *Picard group* of $X$, denoted by $\Pic(X)$, to be the group of isomorphism classes of invertible (i.e. locally isomorphic to $\OO_X$) modules on $X$.
We thus have a canonical isomorphism

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.1 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \Pic(X)
  \simto \HH^1(X,\OO_X^\times)
\tag{1.1}
$$
:::

where $\OO_X^\times$ denotes the sheaf of units of $\OO_X$ (which can be identified with the sheaf of automorphisms of the invertible module **!!TO-DO: type?!!** $\OO_X$).
Note that $X\mapsto\Pic(X)$ is a contravariant functor in $X$ in the evident way, and that the isomorphism [(1.1)](#fga-3-v-equation-1.1) is functorial.

If $X$ is a prescheme over a prescheme $S$, then, for variable $S'$ in the category $\Sch_{/S}$ of preschemes over $S$, we have a contravariant functor $S'\mapsto\Pic(X\times_S S')$ thanks to the above.
This functor has no chance of being "representable" ([@Gro1959, II, A]) since, as a consequence of the existence of *non-trivial automorphisms* of invertible modules that we propose to classify, this functor is not of a *"local nature"* ([@Gro1960a, IV, 5.4]).
There is thus an opportunity to "make it local", by introducing, for every relative prescheme $X/S$, a group of a relative nature

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.2 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \Pic'(X/S)
  = \HH^0(S,\RR^1f_*(\OO_X^\times))
\tag{1.2}
$$
:::

(where $f\colon X\to S$ is the structure morphism) (cf. [@Gro1959, II, C.3]).
In *loco citato* this group is called the relative Picard group, but it will be preferable to call it here the *restricted relative Picard group* of $X/S$, for reasons that will be made clear.
As $S'$ varies over $\Sch_{/S}$, $S'\mapsto\Pic'(X\times_S S'/S')$ is a contravariant functor in $S'$, denote also by $\shPic'_{X/S}$, thus given essentially by the formula

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.3 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \shPic'_{X/S}(S')
  = \Pic(X\times_S S'/S').
\tag{1.3}
$$
:::

\oldpage{232-02}
This functor is now "of local nature", given that did what was necessary to make this happen.
Intuitively, the right-hand side of [(1.3)](#fga-3-v-equation-1.3) can be understood as the set of "algebraic families" of classes of invertible sheaves on (the fibres of) $X/S$, indexed by the parameter prescheme $S'/S$.
When the functor $\shPic'$ is representable, the prescheme over $S$ that represents it is denoted by $\repPic_{X/S}$, and is called the *Picard prescheme* of $X$ over $S$, and so we will then have

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.4 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \Hom_S(S',\repPic_{X/S})
  \cong \shPic'_{X/S}(S')
  = \Pic'(X\times_S S'/S').
\tag{1.4}
$$
:::

There are, however, important cases where $\shPic'_{X/S}$ is not representable (example: the "Brauer--Severi" variety over a field $k$, without a rational point over $k$), but where there nevertheless exists a natural definition of a relative Picard prescheme.
This is due to the fact that, in the definition of the functor $\shPic'$ from the absolute Picard groups $\Pic(X\times_S S'/S')$, we have not localised enough;
more precisely, $\shPic'$ is not in general "compatible with faithfully flat descent".
We now explain the details.

Let $(\scr{M})$ be the set of morphisms of preschemes that are *faithfully flat and quasi-compact*;
this set is stable under base change and composition.
Let $P$ be a contravariant functor from $\Sch_{/S}$ to the category of sets, and, for every $S$-morphism $u\colon T'\to T$ with $u\in(\scr{M})$, consider the diagram

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.5 title="" latex=""}
$$
  P(T)
  \to P(T')
  \rightrightarrows P(T'\times_T T')
\tag{1.5}
$$
:::

which is given by $P$ applied to the diagram
$$
  T
  \from T'
  \underset{\pr_2}{\overset{\pr_1}{\leftleftarrows}} T'\times_T T'.
$$
If $P$ is representable, it follows from the theory of descent ([@Gro1959, I, B, Theorem 2]) that the diagram [(1.5)](#fga-3-v-equation-1.5) is exact for all $u\in(\scr{M})$.
We express this fact by saying that $P$ is compatible with $(\scr{M})$, in the event that $P$ is "compatible with faithfully flat descent", or that the *"presheaf"* $P$ on $\Sch_{/S}$ is a *"sheaf"* for the notion of localisation given by the set $(\scr{M})$.
If $P$ is arbitrary, then a standard procedure, well known in the case of usual topological localisation, allows us to associate to it a "sheaf" $\scr{P}$ and a homomorphism of functors $P\to\scr{P}$ that is universal in an obvious sense.
The construction of $\scr{P}$ can be made explicit in the following way: to define $\scr{P}(T)$, we denote, for all $T'$ over $T$ such that the morphism $u\colon T'\to T$ is in $(\scr{M})$, by $\overline{\HH}^0(T'/T,P)$ the subset of $P(T')$ consisting of the elements $\xi$ such that their images $\xi_1,x_2$ in $P(T'\times_T T')$ are such that there exists a morphism $v\colon T''\to T'\times_T T'$ in $(\scr{M})$ such that $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ have the same image in $P(T'')$.

\oldpage{232-03}
(N.B. The set $\overline{\HH}^0$ thus defined is larger than the set $\HH^0(T'/T,P)$ introduced in [@Gro1959, I, A.4.a]).
As $T'$ varies over fixed $T$ (always with $u\in(\scr{M})$), the $\overline{\HH}^0(T'/T,P)$ form an inductive system (when the set of the $T'$ is endowed with a preorder defined by domination), and we set

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.6 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \scr{P}(T)
  = \varinjlim_{T'} \overline{\HH}^0(T'/T,P).
\tag{1.6}
$$
:::

The functoriality in $T$ of this expression is evident.

When
$$
  P(T)
  = \Pic(X\times_S T)
$$
the contravariant functor on $\Sch_{/S}$ defined by [(1.6)](#fga-3-v-equation-1.6) is called the *relative Picard functor* of $X$ over $S$, and denoted by $\shPic_{X/S}$, and we define the *relative Picard group* of $X$ over $S$, denoted by $\Pic(X/S)$, the group $\shPic_{X/S}(S)$.
We then have an evident bijection

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.7 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \shPic_{X/S}(T)
  \simto \Pic(X\times_S T/T).
\tag{1.7}
$$
:::

An element of $\Pic(X/S)$ is thus defined by means of an element $\xi'$ of a group $\Pic(X\times_S S')$ (where $S'\to S$ is faithfully flat and quasi-compact) such that we can find a faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism $S''\to S'\times_S S'$ such that the two inverse images of $\xi'$ in $\Pic(X\times_S S'')$ are the same.
An element $\xi'$ of $\Pic(X\times_S S')$ and an element $\xi_1$ of $\Pic(X\times_S S_1)$ (satisfying the conditions that we have just stated) define the same element of $\Pic(X/S)$ if and only if there exists a faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism $S'_1\to S'\times_S S_1$ such that the images of the two elements in question in $\Pic(X\times_S S'_1)$ are equal.
It is often convenient to work instead with the functor $P'=\shPic'_{X/S}$ introduced above, and we immediately note that the canonical morphism $P\to P'$ defines an *isomorphism*

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.8 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \scr{P}
  \simto \scr{P}'
\tag{1.8}
$$
:::

which gives a description of $\shPic_{X/S}$ in terms of $\shPic'_{X/S}=P'$ that is usually more convenient.
By [(2.3)](#fga-3-v-corollary-2.3) below, if we replace $P$ by $P'$ in the description of $\Pic(X/S)$ that we have just given then we can take $S''=S'\times_S S'$ and $S'_1=S'\times_S S_1$, at least under the conditions given in *loco citato*.

If the functor $\shPic_{X/S}$ is representable, we say that $X/S$ admits a Picard prescheme, and the prescheme over $S$ that represents the functor is called the *Picard prescheme* of $X$ over $S$, and denoted by $\repPic_{X/S}$.
For this, it evidently suffices that $P'=\shPic_{X/S}$ be representable, since then $P'$ is already a "sheaf", and equation [(1.8)](#fga-3-v-equation-1.8) proves that the morphism $P'\to\scr{P}'$ can be identified with the canonical morphism

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.9 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \shPic'_{X/S}
  \to \shPic_{X/S}
\tag{1.9}
$$
:::

which is then an isomorphism.
This means that our terminology is compatible with that introduced above with [(1.4)](#fga-3-v-equation-1.4).
In general, when $\repPic_{X/S}$ exists it is defined by the functorial isomorphism

::: {.eqref #fga-3-v-equation-1.10 title="" latex=""}
$$
  \Hom_S(S',\repPic_{X/S})
  \simto \Pic(X\times_S S'/S').
\tag{1.10}
