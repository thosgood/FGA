There has been some progress concerning the questions of existence of Picard preschemes raised in [@Gro1959, V]:

a. (Mumford).
  It is not true in general that, if $f\colon X\to S$ is a projective and separable (i.e. flat with separable fibres) morphism, then the Picard prescheme $\repPic_{X/S}$ exists, even if the fibres of $f$ are of dimension $1$ and $S$ is the spectrum of a complete discrete valuation ring.
  A counterexample is given by taking $S=\Spec\mathbb{R}[[t]]$, and taking $X$ to be the subscheme of $\mathbb{P}_S^2$ (with homogeneous variables $x,y,z$) defined by the equation $x^2+y^2=tz^2$, which represents a conic degenerating to two geometrically concurrent lines, but the special fibre over the field $\mathbb{R}$ is nevertheless irreducible (it is given by the equation $x^2+y^2=0$ in $\mathbb{R}$).
  We easily see that, after the étale extension $S'\to S$, with $S'=\Spec\mathbb{C}[[t]]$, the Picard prescheme of $X'/S'$ exists, and we thus obtain an explicit description of it as a sum of copies of $\widetilde{S}$, where $\widetilde{S}$ is induced by $S$ by copying the origin an infinite number of times.
  We easily observe that the descent data on $\repPic_{X'/S'}$ for $S'\to S$ (given here by the actions of the Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ of $S'$ over $S$) is not effective, since the group permutes certain doubled points (so that there are orbits that are not contained in an affine open).
  However, Mumford has shown that, if $f\colon X\to S$ is a separable projective morphism such that, for all $s\in S$, the irreducible components of $X_s$ are geometrically irreducible with respect to $k(s)$, then $\repPic_{X/S}$ exists;
  the proof relies on a refinement of his theorem of passage to the quotient, cf. [-].^[*[Trans.]* The original cites here the 1962 Mumford--Tate seminar --- see translator footnotes in [FGA 3.V](#FGA-3-V.html).]
  Note also that it is still possible that, without any hypotheses on the irreducible components of the fibres $X_s$, the scheme $\repPic_{X/S}^\tau$ (which will be introduced below) still exists.

\oldpage{236-02}
b. (Murre).
  If $X$ is a proper scheme over a field, then $\repPic_{X/k}$ exists.
  The proof partially uses the proof of Chevalley [@Che1960], and is fundamentally based on the group structure of the Picard functor.

For certain additional comments concerning the theory of Picard schemes, most notably in relation to abelian schemes, we recommend consulting [-].^[*[Trans.]* The original again cites here the 1962 Mumford--Tate seminar.]
Finally, a notable shortcoming of the present talk is the absence of "equivalence criteria" that would allow us to compare the Picard scheme of a projective scheme and of its hyperplane sections;
the key theorems for developing such criteria can be found in [@Gro1960b], with which one must combine the existence theorems for Picard schemes.


## Topological properties of preschemes of commutative groups {#fga-3-vi-section-1}

Let $k$ be a field, and $G$ be a prescheme of groups over $k$.
Since the identity element $e$, being rational over $k$, is necessarily closed, it immediately follows that the diagonal of $G\times_k G$ is closed, and so $G$ is *separated*: *every prescheme of groups over a field is separated*.
We denote by $G^0$ the connected component of the identity element $e$.
Since $e$ is rational over $k$, $G^0$ is in fact *geometrically connected*, i.e. $G\mapsto G^0$ is compatible with base change to another field.
It also follows that $G^0$ is stable under multiplication (set-theoretically), and if $G$ is locally Noetherian then $G^0$ is open, and we can consider $G^0$ as an *open subgroup* of $G$.
In what follows, we suppose $G$ to be locally of finite type over $k$;
then $G^0$ is *geometrically irreducible and of finite type over $k$*.
Indeed, we can suppose that $k$ is algebraically closed, and thus that $G$ is reduced (since $G_\red$ is then a subgroup of $G$, taking into account the fact that $G_\red\times_k G_\red$ is also then reduced), and thus simple over $k$ over a non-empty open, and thus everywhere, by translating this open subset.
But then $G$ is locally irreducible, and so its irreducible components are identical to its connected components, and so $G^0$ is irreducible.
So let $U$ be an affine neighbourhood of $e$ in $G^0$;
using the fact that $G^0$ is irreducible, we immediately see that $U\cdot U=D^0$, which proves that $G^0$ is quasi-compact, and thus of finite type over $k$.

Suppose, for simplicity, that $G$ is commutative.
For every integer $n>0$, let $G^{(n)}$ be the inverse image of $G^0$ under the $n$-th power homomorphism $\varphi_n$ to $G$, so $G^{(n)}$ is an open subgroup of $G$.
We set
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    G^\tau
    &= \bigcup_{n>0} G^{(n)}
  \\G^\sigma
    &= \bigcup_{(n,p)=1} G^{(n)}
  \\G^\rho
    &= \bigcup_{h>0} G^{(p^h)}
  \end{aligned}
$$
where $p$ is the characteristic order of the field $k$.
\oldpage{236-03}
These are open subgroups of $G$ that satisfy
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    G^\sigma \cap G^\rho
    &= G^0
  \\G^\sigma \cdot G^\rho
    &= G^\tau.
  \end{aligned}
$$

We can construct the quotient group scheme $G/G^0=N$ (cf. [@Gro1959, IV]) and then define $G^\tau$, $G^\sigma$, and $G^\rho$ as the inverse images in $G$ of the torsion subgroup of $N$ (resp. of its $p$-primary component, resp. of the natural complement of its $p$-primary component, given by the sum of the $q$-primary components for $q$ prime with $q\neq p$).
Note that $N$ is a discrete group scheme that is separable over $k$, thus (once we have chosen an algebraic closure $\overline{k}$ of $k$, giving rise to a Galois group $\pi$) can be identified with an ordinary discrete group on which $\pi$ acts by automorphisms.
It is in this way that we can interpret, in an evident way, the construction of the torsion subgroup and the decomposition of this into its $q$-primary components.
If $G$ is the Picard scheme of a proper scheme $X$ over $k$, then $N$ could be called the (reduced) *Néron--Severi scheme* of $X$ over $k$.
If $G_\red^0$ is a sub-group scheme of $G^0$, which is the case whenever, in particular, $k$ is parfait, or $G^0$ is proper over $k$ (for example if $X$ is geometrically normal), then we can equally introduce the quotient $N'=G/G_\red^0$, which has the tendency to behave better than $N$ from the specialisation point of view, i.e. as $X$ varies over a family of algebraic schemes.
:::

Now let $S$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, and $G$ a group prescheme over $S$ that is locally of finite type over $S$.
We do not assume $G$ to be of finite type over $S$, nor separated over $S$.
We then set
$$
  G^0
  = \bigcup_{s\in S} (G_s)^0
$$
and, if $G$ is commutative,
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    G^\tau
    &= \bigcup_{s\in S} (G_s)^\tau
  \\G^\sigma
    &= \bigcup_{s\in S} (G_s)^\sigma
  \\G^\rho
    &= \bigcup_{s\in S} (G_s)^\rho.
  \end{aligned}
$$
\oldpage{236-04}
These are subsets of $G$, stable under the multiplication of $G$, which does not obviously imply that they can be defined by means of sub-group preschemes of $G$.
Notably, it seems that *there does not exist in a general sub-group prescheme of $G$ whose underlying set is $G^0$*.
Of course, if one of these sets is open, then, endowed with the induced structure, it is an open sub-group prescheme of $G$.
We will see that this is always the case for $G^\tau$;
in this way, from the point of view of representable functors, in particular *from the "specialisation" point of view, numerical equivalence behaves in a more satisfying manner than algebraic equivalence*.
Here are the principle general properties of the sets that we have just defined:

::: {.itenv #fga-3-vi-theorem-1.1 title="Theorem 1.1" latex="{Theorem 1.1}"}
$G^0$, $G^\tau$, $G^\sigma$, and $G^\rho$ are *locally constructible*.
Furthermore:

i. $G^0$ is quasi-compact over $S$.
  If the $G_s^0$ are proper, and $G$ is separated over $S$, then $G^0$ is proper over $S$ and thus closed in $G$.
ii. $G^\tau$ is open.
  If $G^0$ is closed, then so too is $G^\tau$.
iii. If $G^0$ is closed, then so too is $G^\sigma$, provided that we are in equal characteristic, i.e. that all the residue fields of $S$ have the same characteristic.
  If $G^0$ is closed and $G\to S$ is universally open at the points of $G^\sigma$ (cf. [Corollary 1.5](#fga-3-vi-corollary-1.5) below), then $G^\sigma\to S$ is universally open.
iv. If $G^0$ is closed, then so too is $G^\rho$.
  If we are in equal characteristic, and if, for every integer $n>0$ such that $(n,p)=1$, the $n$-th power homomorphism to $G$ is open, then $G^\rho$ is open.
:::

We now give some hints towards the proof.
The fact that $G^0$ is locally constructible, and quasi-compact over $S$, is contained in the following lemma:

::: {.itenv #fga-3-vi-lemma-1.2 title="Lemma 1.2" latex="{Lemma 1.2}"}
If $S\neq\varnothing$ then there exists a non-empty open $U$ in $S$, a group scheme $H$ of finite type over $U$ with connected fibres, and a homomorphism of group schemes $H\to G|U$ that is an open immersion with image $G^0|U$.
:::

::: {.proof}
To prove this lemma, we can suppose that $S$ is irreducible;
let $\eta$ be its generic point.
If we make the base change $S'=\Spec(\OO_{S,\eta})\to S$ then we find a group scheme $G'$ over a local Artinian ring $\OO_{S,s}=A$ inside which we have an *open* sub-group scheme ${G'}^0$ *of finite type over $A$*, as we said above.
This thus comes from a group scheme $H$ of finite type over an open neighbourhood $U$ of $\eta$, and the canonical immersion ${G'}^0\to G'$ comes from an open immersion $H\to G|U$, which will be a homomorphism of group schemes for $U$ small enough.
\oldpage{236-05}
Since the fibres of $H$ are connected if we take $U$ small enough, and since they are all of the same dimension, namely that of the fibres of $G$, for $U$ small enough, it follows that, for all $s\in U$, the image of $H_s$ in $G_s$ is exactly $G_s^0$ (for $U$ small enough), which proves the lemma.
:::

The second claim in [(1.1), (i)](#fga-3-vi-theorem-1.1) is contained in the following lemma (which we apply to an quasi-compact open neighbourhood of $G^0$ in $G$):

::: {.itenv #fga-3-vi-lemma-1.3 title="Lemma 1.3" latex="{Lemma 1.3}"}
Let $X$ be a separated prescheme of finite type over $S$, with $S$ locally Noetherian, and let $g$ be a section of $X$ over $S$, and $X^0$ the union of the connected components of the $g(s)$ in the $X_s$.
Let $s\in S$ be such that $X_s^0$ is proper over $k(s)$.
Then there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $s$ such that $X^0|U$ is proper over $U$, and a fortiori closed in $X|U$.
