There has been some progress concerning the questions of existence of Picard preschemes raised in [@Gro1959, V]:

a. (Mumford).
  It is not true in general that, if $f\colon X\to S$ is a projective and separable (i.e. flat with separable fibres) morphism, then the Picard prescheme $\repPic_{X/S}$ exists, even if the fibres of $f$ are of dimension $1$ and $S$ is the spectrum of a complete discrete valuation ring.
  A counterexample is given by taking $S=\Spec\mathbb{R}[[t]]$, and taking $X$ to be the subscheme of $\mathbb{P}_S^2$ (with homogeneous variables $x,y,z$) defined by the equation $x^2+y^2=tz^2$, which represents a conic degenerating to two geometrically concurrent lines, but the special fibre over the field $\mathbb{R}$ is nevertheless irreducible (it is given by the equation $x^2+y^2=0$ in $\mathbb{R}$).
  We easily see that, after the étale extension $S'\to S$, with $S'=\Spec\mathbb{C}[[t]]$, the Picard prescheme of $X'/S'$ exists, and we thus obtain an explicit description of it as a sum of copies of $\widetilde{S}$, where $\widetilde{S}$ is induced by $S$ by copying the origin an infinite number of times.
  We easily observe that the descent data on $\repPic_{X'/S'}$ for $S'\to S$ (given here by the actions of the Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ of $S'$ over $S$) is not effective, since the group permutes certain doubled points (so that there are orbits that are not contained in an affine open).
  However, Mumford has shown that, if $f\colon X\to S$ is a separable projective morphism such that, for all $s\in S$, the irreducible components of $X_s$ are geometrically irreducible with respect to $k(s)$, then $\repPic_{X/S}$ exists;
  the proof relies on a refinement of his theorem of passage to the quotient, cf. [-].^[*[Trans.]* The original cites here the 1962 Mumford--Tate seminar --- see translator footnotes in [FGA 3.V](#FGA-3-V.html).]
  Note also that it is still possible that, without any hypotheses on the irreducible components of the fibres $X_s$, the scheme $\repPic_{X/S}^\tau$ (which will be introduced below) still exists.

b. (Murre).
  If $X$ is a proper scheme over a field, then $\repPic_{X/k}$ exists.
  The proof partially uses the proof of Chevalley [@Che1960], and is fundamentally based on the group structure of the Picard functor.

For certain additional comments concerning the theory of Picard schemes, most notably in relation to abelian schemes, we recommend consulting [-].^[*[Trans.]* The original again cites here the 1962 Mumford--Tate seminar.]
Finally, a notable shortcoming of the present talk is the absence of "equivalence criteria" that would allow us to compare the Picard scheme of a projective scheme and of its hyperplane sections;
the key theorems for developing such criteria can be found in [@Gro1960b], with which one must combine the existence theorems for Picard schemes.


## Topological properties of preschemes of commutative groups {#fga-3-vi-section-1}

Let $k$ be a field, and $G$ be a prescheme of groups over $k$.
Since the identity element $e$, being rational over $k$, is necessarily closed, it immediately follows that the diagonal of $G\times_k G$ is closed, and so $G$ is *separated*: *every prescheme of groups over a field is separated*.
We denote by $G^0$ the connected component of the identity element $e$.
Since $e$ is rational over $k$, $G^0$ is in fact *geometrically connected*, i.e. $G\mapsto G^0$ is compatible with base change to another field.
It also follows that $G^0$ is stable under multiplication (set-theoretically), and if $G$ is locally Noetherian then $G^0$ is open, and we can consider $G^0$ as an *open subgroup* of $G$.
In what follows, we suppose $G$ to be locally of finite type over $k$;
then $G^0$ is *geometrically irreducible and of finite type over $k$*.
Indeed, we can suppose that $k$ is algebraically closed, and thus that $G$ is reduced (since $G_\red$ is then a subgroup of $G$, taking into account the fact that $G_\red\times_k G_\red$ is also then reduced), and thus simple over $k$ over a non-empty open, and thus everywhere, by translating this open subset.
But then $G$ is locally irreducible, and so its irreducible components are identical to its connected components, and so $G^0$ is irreducible.
So let $U$ be an affine neighbourhood of $e$ in $G^0$;
using the fact that $G^0$ is irreducible, we immediately see that $U\cdot U=D^0$, which proves that $G^0$ is quasi-compact, and thus of finite type over $k$.

Suppose, for simplicity, that $G$ is commutative.
For every integer $n>0$, let $G^{(n)}$ be the inverse image of $G^0$ under the $n$-th power homomorphism $\varphi_n$ to $G$, so $G^{(n)}$ is an open subgroup of $G$.
We set
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    G^\tau
    &= \bigcup_{n>0} G^{(n)}
  \\G^\sigma
    &= \bigcup_{(n,p)=1} G^{(n)}
  \\G^\rho
    &= \bigcup_{h>0} G^{(p^h)}
  \end{aligned}
$$
where $p$ is the characteristic order of the field $k$.
\oldpage{236-03}
These are open subgroups of $G$ that satisfy
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    G^\sigma \cap G^\rho
    &= G^0
  \\G^\sigma \cdot G^\rho
    &= G^\tau.
  \end{aligned}
$$
