The results that follow, inspired by Serre's "theorem of algebraic duality", were discovered in the winter of 1955 and the winter of 1956.
They can be established very simply, thanks to reasonably elementary results on the cohomology of projective spaces [@1-3] and an intensive use of Cartan--Eilenberg's homological algebra, in the form given in [@1-2].


## **1.** Ext of sheaves of modules {#FGA-1-section-1}

_(cf. @1-2, chap. 3 and 4)_

Let $X$ be a topological space endowed with a sheaf $\scr{O}$ of unital (but not necessarily commutative) rings.
We consider the abelian category $\cal{C}^\scr{O}$ of sheaves of $\scr{O}$-modules, which are also referred to as $\scr{O}$-modules.
We know that every object of this category admits an injective resolution, which allows us to define the $\Ext$ functors that have the well-known formal properties.
More precisely, to avoid confusion, we denote by $\Hom_\scr{O}(X;\scr{A},\scr{B})$, or simply $\Hom(X;\scr{A},\scr{B})$, the abelian _groups_ of $\scr{O}$-homomorphisms from $\scr{A}$ to $\scr{B}$, whereas $\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},\scr{B})$ denotes the _sheaf_ of germs of homomorphisms from $\scr{A}$ to $\scr{B}$ (where $\scr{A},\scr{B}\in \cal{C}^\scr{O}$).
We define, for fixed $\scr{A}\in \cal{C}^\scr{O}$, functors $h_\scr{A}$ and $\underline{h}_\scr{A}$, with values in the category $\cal{C}$ of abelian groups and the category $\cal{C}^Z$ of abelian sheaves on $X$ (respectively), by the formulas:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    h_\scr{A}(\scr{B}) &= \Hom_\scr{O}(X;\scr{A},\scr{B})
  \\\underline{h}_\scr{A}(\scr{B}) &= \shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},\scr{B}).
  \end{aligned}
\tag{1.1}
$$
The functors $h_\scr{A}$ and $\underline{h}_\scr{A}$ are left exact and covariant, and so we consider their right-derived functors, denoted by $\Ext_\scr{O}^p(X;\scr{A},\scr{B})$ and $\shExt_\scr{O}^p(\scr{A},\scr{B})$ (respectively).
We then have, by definition,

::: {.eqref #FGA-1-equation-1.2 title="" data-latex=""}
$$
  \begin{gathered}
    \Ext_\scr{O}^p(X;\scr{A},\scr{B}) = (\RR^p h_\scr{A})(\scr{B}) = \HH^p(\Hom_\scr{O}(X;\scr{A},C(\scr{B})))
  \\\shExt_\scr{O}^p(\scr{A},\scr{B}) = (\RR^p \underline{h}_\scr{A})(\scr{B}) = \HH^p(\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},C(\scr{B})))
  \end{gathered}
\tag{1.2}
$$
:::

where $\RR^p$ denotes the passage to right-derived functors, and where $C(\scr{B})$ denotes an arbitrary injective resolution of $\scr{B}$ in $\cal{C}^\scr{O}$.
We denote by $\Gamma\colon\cal{C}^Z\to\cal{C}$ the "sections" functor;
recall that its right-derived functors are denoted by $B\mapsto\HH^p(X,\scr{B})$:
$$
  \HH^p(X,\scr{B}) = (\RR^p\Gamma)(\scr{B}) = \HH^p(\Gamma(C(\scr{B}))).
\tag{1.3}
$$

\oldpage{149-02}

We evidently have $h_\scr{A}=\Gamma\underline{h}_\scr{A}$;
we can also show that $\underline{h}_\scr{A}$ sends injective objects to $\Gamma$-acyclic objects.
From this, it is a well-known result that:

:::: {.itenv #FGA-1-proposition-1 title="Proposition 1" data-latex="{Proposition 1}"}
For every $\scr{O}$-module $\scr{A}$, there exists a cohomological spectral functor on $\cal{C}^\scr{O}$ that abuts to the graded functor $(\Ext_\scr{O}^\bullet(X;\scr{A},\scr{B}))$, and whose initial page is

::: {.eqref #FGA-1-equation-1.4 title="" data-latex=""}
$$
  E_2^{p,q}(\scr{A},\scr{B}) = \HH^p(X,\shExt_\scr{O}^q(\scr{A},\scr{B})).
\tag{1.4}
$$
:::
::::

From this, we obtain "_boundary homomorphisms_", as well as a short exact sequence, which we will not write.

:::: {.itenv #FGA-1-proposition-1-corollary-1 title="Corollary 1" data-latex="{Corollary 1}"}
If $\scr{A}$ is locally isomorphic to $\scr{O}^n$, then we have canonical isomorphisms

::: {.eqref #FGA-1-equation-1.5 title="" data-latex=""}
$$
  \Ext_\scr{O}^p(X;\scr{A},\scr{B}) \xleftarrow{\sim} \HH^p(x,\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},\scr{B}))
\tag{1.5}
$$
:::

(given by the boundary homomorphisms of the spectral sequence).
In particular, we have a canonical isomorphism
$$
  \Ext_\scr{O}^p(X;\scr{O},\scr{B}) = \HH^p(X,\scr{B}).
\tag{1.6}
$$
::::

To use these results, we need to know how to explicitly describe the $\Ext_\scr{O}^p(\scr{A},\scr{B})$.
They are functors that we calculate locally, i.e. if $V$ is an open subset of $X$, then
$$
  \shExt_\scr{O}^p(\scr{A},\scr{B})|U = \shExt_{\scr{O}|U}^p(\scr{A}|U,\scr{B}|U),
$$
as follows from the fact that the restriction to $U$ of an injective $\scr{O}$-module is an injective $(\scr{O}|U)$-module.
Furthermore, for fixed $x\in X$, we have functorial homomorphisms

::: {.eqref #FGA-1-equation-1.7 title="" data-latex=""}
$$
  \shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},\scr{B})_x \to \Hom_{\scr{O}_x}(\scr{A}_x,\scr{B}_x)
\tag{1.7}
$$
:::

that uniquely extend to homomorphisms of cohomological functors (in $\scr{B}$):

::: {.eqref #FGA-1-equation-1.8 title="" data-latex=""}
$$
  \shExt_\scr{O}^p(\scr{A},\scr{B})_x \to \Ext_{\scr{O}_x}^p(\scr{A}_x,\scr{B}_x).
\tag{1.8}
$$
:::

::: {.itenv #FGA-1-proposition-2 title="Proposition 2" data-latex="{Proposition 2}"}
If $\scr{A}$ is isomorphic, in a neighbourhood of $x$, to the cokernel of some homomorphism $\scr{O}^m\to\scr{O}^n$, then [(1.7)](#FGA-1-equation-1.7) is an isomorphism for all $p$.
This is the case, in particular, if $\scr{A}$ is a coherent $\scr{O}$-module [@1-3].
:::

\oldpage{149-03}

::: {.itenv #FGA-1-proposition-3 title="Proposition 3" data-latex="{Proposition 3}"}
Let $\scr{L}_\bullet=(\scr{L}_i)$ be a left resolution of the $\scr{O}$-module $\scr{A}$ by $\scr{O}$-modules that are all locally isomorphic to some $\scr{O}^n$.
Then $\shExt_\scr{O}(\scr{A},\scr{B})$ can be identified with $\HH^\bullet(\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{L}_\bullet,\scr{B}))$, and $\Ext_\scr{O}(X;\scr{A},\scr{B})$ can be identified with the hypercohomology of $X$ with respect to the complex $\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{L}_\bullet,\scr{B})$.
:::

::: {.proof}
The proof is standard: we consider the bicomplex $\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{L}_\bullet,C(\scr{B}))$, where $C(\scr{B})$ is an injective resolution of $\scr{B}$, as well as the natural homomorphisms into this bicomplex from $\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{L}_\bullet,\scr{B})$ and $\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},C(\scr{B}))$.
}
:::

To finish, we note that the two $\Ext$ functors introduced in [(1.2)](#FGA-1-equation-1.2) are not only cohomological functors in $\scr{B}$, but in fact _cohomological bifunctors_, covariant in $\scr{B}$, and contravariant in $\scr{A}$.


## **2.** The composition law in $\Ext$ {#FGA-1-section-2}

The results of this section are due, independently, to Cartier and Yoneda;
see a talk by Cartier [@1-1] for more details.
Let $\cal{C}$ be an abelian category, and let $K$ and $L$ be two graded objects of $\cal{C}$.
We denote by $\Hom(K,L)$ the graded abelian group whose degree-$n$ component consists of homogeneous homomorphisms of degree $n$ from $K$ to $L$ (i.e. systems $(u_i)$ of homomorphisms $K^i\to L^{i+n}$).
If $K$ and $L$ are complexes (with differentials of degree $+1$, to fix conventions), then we endow $\Hom(K,L)$ with the differential operator given by
$$
  \delta(u) = \mathrm{d}u + (-1)^{n+1}u\mathrm{d}
  \quad\text{where }n=\deg(u)
\tag{2.1}
$$
which makes it a complex with a differential of degree $+1$.
The cycles of degree $n$ are the maps of degree $n$ that anticommute with $u$ (as homogeneous maps).
We can then consider $\HH^\bullet(\Hom(K,L))$, which is an invariant of the homotopy types of $K$ and $L$, and which we sometimes denote by $\HH^\bullet(K,L)$.
If we have a third complex $M$, then the composition of homomorphisms defines a pairing $\Hom(K,L)\times\Hom(L,M)\to\Hom(K,M)$ which is compatible with the differential maps, whence, by passing to the cohomology of pairings,

::: {.eqref #FGA-1-equation-2.2 title="" data-latex=""}
$$
  \HH^\bullet(K,L)\times\HH^\bullet(L,M) \to \HH^\bullet(K,M)
\tag{2.2}
$$
:::

which we write as $(u,v)\mapsto vu$.
These pairings satisfy an evident associativity property;
in particular, $\HH^\bullet(K,K)$ is an associative graded unital ring, and $\HH^\bullet(K,L)$ (resp. $\HH^\bullet(L,K)$) is a graded right (resp. left) module over this ring, etc.
In dimension $0$, [(2.2)](#FGA-1-equation-2.2) reduces to the composition of permissible homomorphisms of complexes.
Finally, an exact sequence of complexes $0\to K'\to K\to K''\to0$ such that, for all $i$, $K'^i$ can be identified with a direct factor of $K^i$, gives rise to an exact sequence of complexes of groups $\Hom(K'',L)$, etc., whence a coboundary map $\HH^i(K',L)\to\HH^{i+1}(K'',L)$.
We similarly define the boundary maps relative to an exact sequence in $L$.
The pairings in [(2.2)](#FGA-1-equation-2.2) are compatible, in the usual sense, with these coboundary maps.

\oldpage{149-04}

Now suppose that $\cal{C}$ is a category such that every element $A$ of $\cal{C}$ admits an injective resolution $C(A)$.
We then note that, using one of the many variants of the theorem of bicomplexes,
$$
  \HH^\bullet(C(A),C(B)) = \HH^\bullet(\Hom(C(A),C(B)))
$$
is canonically isomorphic to
$$
  \HH^\bullet(\Hom(A,C(B))) = \Ext^\bullet(A,B).
$$
The coboundary maps described above give coboundary maps of the $\Ext$.
Furthermore, the pairings in [(2.2)](#FGA-1-equation-2.2) give associative pairings here:
$$
  \Ext^\bullet(A,B)\times\Ext^\bullet(B,C) \to \Ext^\bullet(A,C)
\tag{2.3}
$$
and these are compatible with the coboundary maps.
In particular, $\Ext^\bullet(A,A)$ is an associative graded unital ring, etc.
(We can show in an analogous manner that the $\Ext$ functors work in the derived functors of an arbitrary functor;
we do not make use of this fact here).

In the case where the category in question is the category $\cal{C}^\scr{O}$ of $\scr{O}$-modules on $X$, we then obtain pairings
\[
\label{2.4}
  \Ext_\scr{O}^p(X;\scr{A},\scr{B})\times\Ext_\scr{O}^q(X;\scr{B},\scr{C}) \to \Ext_\scr{O}^{p+q}(X;\scr{A},\scr{C})
\tag{2.4}
\]
that can be calculated as has already been said.
The same method, but replacing the category of abelian groups with the category of abelian sheaves on $X$, and the $\Hom$ functors by the $\shHom$ functors, again defines pairings, having the same formal properties, and of a ``local nature'' this time:
\[
\label{2.5}
  \shExt_\scr{O}^p(\scr{A},\scr{B})\times\shExt_\scr{O}^q(\scr{B},\scr{C}) \to \shExt_\scr{O}^{p+q}(\scr{A},\scr{C}).
\tag{2.5}
\]
These can be understood by noting that the homomorphisms in \hyperref[1.8]{(1.8)} are compatible with the pairings between the $\Ext$.

\oldpage{149-05}
Finally, recall that we also have a multiplicative structure between functors $\HH^p(X,A)$ (the cup product).
We note then that the spectral sequences of \hyperref[proposition1]{Proposition 1} are compatible with the multiplicative structures;
more precisely, we have a pairing from the spectral sequence $E(A,B)$ with the spectral sequence $E(B,C)$ to the spectral sequence $E(A,C)$ that abuts to the pairing between the global $\Ext$, and whose initial page comes from the cup product and the local $\Ext$ pairings in the right-hand side of \hyperref[1.4]{(1.4)}.
It then follows, in particular, that the ``boundary homomorphisms''
\[
\label{2.6}
  \Ext_\scr{O}^n(X;\scr{A},\scr{B}) \to \HH^0(X;\shExt_\scr{O}^n(\scr{A},\scr{B}))
\tag{2.6}
\]
\[
\label{2.7}
  \HH^n(X,\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},\scr{B})) \to \Ext_\scr{O}^n(X;\scr{A},\scr{B})
\tag{2.7}
\]
are compatible with the multiplicative structures.
So if we restrict to sheaves that are locally isomorphic to some $\scr{O}^m$, then this completely explains the composition of the global $\Ext$ by means of the cup product, taking into account the isomorphism of \hyperref[1.5]{(1.5)}.
