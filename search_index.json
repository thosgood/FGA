[["index.html", "Foundations of Algebraic Geometry Foreword", " Foundations of Algebraic Geometry A. Grothendieck 1957–1962 !! TO-DO: translator’s note !! Version: GIT_COMMIT_HASH_VARIABLE Foreword In the Séminaire Bourbaki, between 1957 and 1962, we gave eight exposés on the foundations of algebraic geometry. With the exception of the first, these exposés are expressed in the language of schemes. All of the stated results will find their place in Jean Dieudonné and Alexander Grothendieck’s “Éléments de géométrie algébrique”. However, none of the essence of any of these exposés is currently found in any of the chapters (neither published nor still in preperation) of the EGA, nor in any other book or article, and this will probably remain the case for a few more years still. This is the main reason that persuaded us to combine these exposés, giving readers access to a number of ideas and key results of the theory of schemes whilst awaiting a well-written summary. Also, reading these chapters will allow the reader to quickly familiarise themselves with the aforementioned results and ideas, without being bothered by the necessarily cumbersome details of a systematic treatment, and also endow them with vital motivations for the study of such a treatment. For the sake of the reader, we have assembled here some comments and errata, grouped by exposé, that, most notably, show the progress accomplished since the editing of this text, as well as indicating some supplementary references.1 Many of the results appearing in these exposés have been discussed in detail in the Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie, as well as in the two subsequent seminars at Harvard, in 1961–62 (the first by myself, and the second by Mumford–Tate), the notes for which are currently in preparation by Lichtenbaum. [Trans.] Rather than translating the comments and errata here, we have inserted them throughout the text in the relevant places; we preface them with “[Comp.]” (except for small corrections, which we insert silently).↩︎ "],["FGA-1.html", "1 — Duality theorems for coherent algebraic sheaves 1. \\operatorname{Ext} of sheaves of modules 2.

Séminaire Bourbaki 9 (1956–57), Talk no. 149. The results that follow, inspired by Serre’s “theorem of algebraic duality”, were discovered in the winter of 1955 and the winter of 1956. They can be established very simply, thanks to reasonably elementary results on the cohomology of projective spaces [21] and an intensive use of Cartan–Eilenberg’s homological algebra, in the form given in [7]. 1. \\operatorname{Ext} of sheaves of modules (cf. [7], chap. 3 and 4) Let X be a topological space endowed with a sheaf {\\mathscr{O}} of unital (but not necessarily commutative) rings. We consider the abelian category {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} of sheaves of {\\mathscr{O}}-modules, which are also referred to as {\\mathscr{O}}-modules. We know that every object of this category admits an injective resolution, which allows us to define the \\operatorname{Ext} functors that have the well-known formal properties. More precisely, to avoid confusion, we denote by \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}), or simply \\operatorname{Hom}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}), the abelian groups of {\\mathscr{O}}-homomorphisms from {\\mathscr{A}} to {\\mathscr{B}}, whereas \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) denotes the sheaf of germs of homomorphisms from {\\mathscr{A}} to {\\mathscr{B}} (where {\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}\\in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}). We define, for fixed {\\mathscr{A}}\\in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}, functors h_{\\mathscr{A}} and \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}, with values in the category {\\mathcal{C}} of abelian groups and the category {\\mathcal{C}}^Z of abelian sheaves on X (respectively), by the formulas: \\begin{aligned} h_{\\mathscr{A}}({\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\\\\\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}({\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}). \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1} The functors h_{\\mathscr{A}} and \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}} are left exact and covariant, and so we consider their right-derived functors, denoted by \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) and \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) (respectively). We then have, by definition, \\begin{gathered} \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p h_{\\mathscr{A}})({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}}))) \\\\\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}})({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}}))) \\end{gathered} \\tag{1.2} where \\operatorname{R}^p denotes the passage to right-derived functors, and where C({\\mathscr{B}}) denotes an arbitrary injective resolution of {\\mathscr{B}} in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}. We denote by \\Gamma\\colon{\\mathcal{C}}^Z\\to{\\mathcal{C}} the “sections” functor; recall that its right-derived functors are denoted by B\\mapsto\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}): \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma)({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\Gamma(C({\\mathscr{B}}))). \\tag{1.3} We evidently have h_{\\mathscr{A}}=\\Gamma\\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}; we can also show that \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}} sends injective objects to \\Gamma-acyclic objects. From this, it is a well-known result that: For every {\\mathscr{O}}-module {\\mathscr{A}}, there exists a cohomological spectral functor on {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} that abuts to the graded functor (\\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^\\bullet(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})), and whose initial page is E_2^{p,q}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})). \\tag{1.4} From this, we obtain “boundary homomorphisms”, as well as a short exact sequence, which we will not write. If {\\mathscr{A}} is locally isomorphic to {\\mathscr{O}}^n, then we have canonical isomorphisms \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\xleftarrow{\\sim} \\operatorname{H}^p(x,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\tag{1.5} (given by the boundary homomorphisms of the spectral sequence). In particular, we have a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}). \\tag{1.6} To use these results, we need to know how to explicitly describe the \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}). They are functors that we calculate locally, i.e. if V is an open subset of X, then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})|U = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}|U}^p({\\mathscr{A}}|U,{\\mathscr{B}}|U), as follows from the fact that the restriction to U of an injective {\\mathscr{O}}-module is an injective ({\\mathscr{O}}|U)-module. Furthermore, for fixed x\\in X, we have functorial homomorphisms \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})_x \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_x}({\\mathscr{A}}_x,{\\mathscr{B}}_x) \\tag{1.7} that uniquely extend to homomorphisms of cohomological functors (in {\\mathscr{B}}): \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})_x \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_x}^p({\\mathscr{A}}_x,{\\mathscr{B}}_x). \\tag{1.8} If {\\mathscr{A}} is isomorphic, in a neighbourhood of x, to the cokernel of some homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}^m\\to{\\mathscr{O}}^n, then (1.7) is an isomorphism for all p. This is the case, in particular, if {\\mathscr{A}} is a coherent {\\mathscr{O}}-module [21]. Let {\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet=({\\mathscr{L}}_i) be a left resolution of the {\\mathscr{O}}-module {\\mathscr{A}} by {\\mathscr{O}}-modules that are all locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{O}}^n. Then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) can be identified with \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}})), and \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) can be identified with the hypercohomology of X with respect to the complex \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}}). Proof. The proof is standard: we consider the bicomplex \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,C({\\mathscr{B}})), where C({\\mathscr{B}}) is an injective resolution of {\\mathscr{B}}, as well as the natural homomorphisms into this bicomplex from \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}}) and \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}})). } To finish, we note that the two \\operatorname{Ext} functors introduced in (1.2) are not only cohomological functors in {\\mathscr{B}}, but in fact cohomological bifunctors, covariant in {\\mathscr{B}}, and contravariant in {\\mathscr{A}}. 2. The composition law in \\operatorname{Ext} The results of this section are due, independently, to Cartier and Yoneda; see a talk by Cartier [2] for more details. Let {\\mathcal{C}} be an abelian category, and let K and L be two graded objects of {\\mathcal{C}}. We denote by \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L) the graded abelian group whose degree-n component consists of homogeneous homomorphisms of degree n from K to L (i.e. systems (u_i) of homomorphisms K^i\\to L^{i+n}). If K and L are complexes (with differentials of degree +1, to fix conventions), then we endow \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L) with the differential operator given by \\delta(u) = \\mathrm{d}u + (-1)^{n+1}u\\mathrm{d} \\quad\\text{where }n=\\deg(u) \\tag{2.1} which makes it a complex with a differential of degree +1. The cycles of degree n are the maps of degree n that anticommute with u (as homogeneous maps). We can then consider \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(K,L)), which is an invariant of the homotopy types of K and L, and which we sometimes denote by \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L). If we have a third complex M, then the composition of homomorphisms defines a pairing \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L)\\times\\operatorname{Hom}(L,M)\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(K,M) which is compatible with the differential maps, whence, by passing to the cohomology of pairings, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L)\\times\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(L,M) \\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,M) \\tag{2.2} which we write as (u,v)\\mapsto vu. These pairings satisfy an evident associativity property; in particular, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,K) is an associative graded unital ring, and \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L) (resp. \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(L,K)) is a graded right (resp. left) module over this ring, etc. In dimension 0, (2.2) reduces to the composition of permissible homomorphisms of complexes. Finally, an exact sequence of complexes 0\\to K'\\to K\\to K''\\to0 such that, for all i, K'^i can be identified with a direct factor of K^i, gives rise to an exact sequence of complexes of groups \\operatorname{Hom}(K'',L), etc., whence a coboundary map \\operatorname{H}^i(K',L)\\to\\operatorname{H}^{i+1}(K'',L). We similarly define the boundary maps relative to an exact sequence in L. The pairings in (2.2) are compatible, in the usual sense, with these coboundary maps. Now suppose that {\\mathcal{C}} is a category such that every element A of {\\mathcal{C}} admits an injective resolution C(A). We then note that, using one of the many variants of the theorem of bicomplexes, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(C(A),C(B)) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(C(A),C(B))) is canonically isomorphic to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(A,C(B))) = \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,B). The coboundary maps described above give coboundary maps of the \\operatorname{Ext}. Furthermore, the pairings in (2.2) give associative pairings here: \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,B)\\times\\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(B,C) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,C) \\tag{2.3} and these are compatible with the coboundary maps. In particular, \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,A) is an associative graded unital ring, etc. (We can show in an analogous manner that the \\operatorname{Ext} functors behave like derived functors of an arbitrary functor; we do not make use of this fact here). In the case where the category in question is the category {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} of {\\mathscr{O}}-modules on X, we then obtain pairings \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})\\times\\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q(X;{\\mathscr{B}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^{p+q}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\tag{2.4} that can be calculated as already described. The same method, but replacing the category of abelian groups with the category of abelian sheaves on X, and the \\operatorname{Hom} functors by the \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}} functors, again defines pairings, having the same formal properties, and of a “local nature” this time: \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})\\times\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q({\\mathscr{B}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^{p+q}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{C}}). \\tag{2.5} These can be understood by noting that the homomorphisms in (1.8) are compatible with the pairings between the \\operatorname{Ext}. Finally, recall that we also have a multiplicative structure between functors \\operatorname{H}^p(X,A), namely the cup product. We note then that the spectral sequences of Proposition 1 are compatible with the multiplicative structures; more precisely, we have a pairing from the spectral sequence E(A,B) with the spectral sequence E(B,C) to the spectral sequence E(A,C) that abuts to the pairing between the global \\operatorname{Ext}, and whose initial page comes from the cup product and the local \\operatorname{Ext} pairings in the right-hand side of (1.4). It then follows, in particular, that the “boundary homomorphisms” \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(X;\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\tag{2.6} \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\tag{2.7} are compatible with the multiplicative structures. So, if we restrict to sheaves that are locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{O}}^m, then this completely explains the composition of the global \\operatorname{Ext} by means of the cup product, taking into account the isomorphisms of (1.5). 3. Results concerning local cohomology Let A be a unital commutative ring endowed with an ideal {\\mathfrak{J}}. We will define, for any A-module M, functorial homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{Hom}_A(\\wedge^p{\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2,M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) \\\\\\operatorname{Tor}_p^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\leftarrow(\\wedge^p{\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2)\\otimes\\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.1} where the tensor and exterior products are taken over the ring A; note also that {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2 is in fact an A/{\\mathfrak{J}}-module, and that its exterior powers as an A-module agree with its exterior powers as an A/{\\mathfrak{J}}-module. The definition of the homomorphisms in (3.1) come from the definition, for every system x=(x_1,\\ldots,x_p) of points of {\\mathfrak{J}}, of homomorphisms \\varphi_x given by \\begin{aligned} \\varphi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}} \\\\\\varphi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{Tor}_p^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.2} such that the following conditions are satisfied: \\varphi_{x_1,\\ldots,x_p} depends on the system of the x_i\\in{\\mathfrak{J}} in an alternating A-multilinear way; \\varphi_{x_1,\\ldots,x_p} is zero when any of the x_i is in {\\mathfrak{J}}^2. In fact, ii. follows from i., since a\\varphi_x=0 for a\\in{\\mathfrak{J}}, as we see by noting that all the modules in (3.2) are annihilated by {\\mathfrak{J}}. To define the \\varphi_x, we consider the complex K_x whose underlying A-modules are the \\wedge A^p, and whose differential is the interior product i_x by x, considered as a linear form on A^p with components x_1,\\ldots,x_p. The differential is of degree -1, the degrees of the complex are positive, and the cohomology of this complex in dimension 0 is A/(x_1A+\\ldots+x_pA). Since the x_i are in {\\mathfrak{J}}, we obtain an augmentation K_{x,0}\\to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. Thus K_x is a free augmented complex, with augmentation module A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. We thus obtain known homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Ext}_A^\\bullet(\\operatorname{H}_0(K_x),M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) \\\\\\operatorname{Tor}_\\bullet^A(\\operatorname{H}_0(K_x),M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{H}_\\bullet(K_x\\otimes M) \\end{aligned} whence, by composing with the homomorphisms to the \\operatorname{Ext} and the \\operatorname{Tor} induced by the augmentation homomorphism \\operatorname{H}_0(K_x)\\to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, we obtain homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\psi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Ext}_A^\\bullet(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) \\\\\\psi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Tor}_\\bullet^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{H}_\\bullet(K_x\\otimes M). \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.3} But we immediately note that, in the maximal dimension p, the cohomology of the right-hand side is M(x_1M+\\ldots+x_pM) (resp. the set of elements of M that are annihilated by each of the x_i). Since the x_i are in {\\mathfrak{J}}, we thus obtain homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{H}^p(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) &amp;\\to M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}} \\\\\\operatorname{H}_p(K_x\\otimes M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M). \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.4} By composing the homomorphisms in (3.3) and (3.4) we obtain the homomorphisms in (3.2) that we wanted to define. The verification of i. is tedious, but does not present any difficulties. Let A be a commutative unital ring, and let (x_1,\\ldots,x_p) be a sequence of elements of A such that, for 1\\leqslant i\\leqslant p, the image of x_i in the quotient of A by the ideal generated by (x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1}) is not a zero divisor. Let {\\mathfrak{J}} be the ideal generated by the x_i. Then {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2 is a free (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module, with basis given by the canonical images of the x_i; the complex K_x is a free resolution of A/{\\mathfrak{J}}; and, for every A-modules M, the homomorphisms in (3.1) in dimension p are bijective. The same is true for the analogous homomorphisms defined for arbitrary degree i as long as {\\mathfrak{J}}\\cdot M=0. (The essential point, from which all others follow, is the acyclicity of K_x, which is a well-known fact, under the conditions given). With A and {\\mathfrak{J}} as above, suppose further that A is a regular affine algebra of \\dim n over a perfect field k, and that A/{\\mathfrak{J}} is a regular affine algebra. Denote by \\Omega^i(A) and \\Omega^i(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) the modules of Kähler differentials. Then we have a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(\\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}),\\Omega^n(A)) = A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. \\tag{3.5} which is compatible with localisation. Proof. Indeed, \\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) is a free (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module of rank 1, and, similarly, \\Omega^n(A) is a free A-module of rank n, and so the left-hand side is equal to \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},A) \\otimes \\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}})' \\otimes \\Omega^n(A) (where the “'” notation denotes the dual (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module). The tensor product of these last two factors can be identified with \\wedge^p({\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2), and so the whole thing can be identified with \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},\\wedge^p({\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2)), and thus, by the proposition, with \\operatorname{Hom}_A(\\wedge^p {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2,\\wedge^p {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2) i.e. to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. In particular, there is a distinguished element in \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(\\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}),\\Omega^n(A)), corresponding to the unit of A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, called the fundamental class of the ideal {\\mathfrak{J}} in A. (In fact, it can be defined under rather more general conditions). We can write Corollary 1 in a more geometric and global form: Let X be a non-singular variety over an algebraically-closed field k, Y a closed non-singular subvariety of X, {\\mathscr{O}}_X the structure sheaf of X, and {\\mathscr{O}}_Y the structure sheaf of Y, considered as a quotient sheaf of {\\mathscr{O}}_X. Let n be the dimension of X, and n-p the dimension of Y. Let \\Omega_X (resp. \\Omega_Y) be the sheaf of germs of regular differential forms on X (resp. Y). Then we have canonical isomorphisms \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(\\Omega_Y^{n-p},\\Omega_X^n) = {\\mathscr{O}}_Y \\tag{3.6} as well as \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^n) = \\Omega_Y^{n-p}. \\tag{3.6 bis} Equation (3.6 bis) can serve as the definition of \\Omega_Y^{n-p} when Y is a singular variety. More precisely: Let X be a non-singular algebraic variety of dimension n, and let Y be an algebraic subset of dimension q=n-p of X. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X with support contained in Y, and let {\\mathscr{L}} be a locally-free algebraic sheaf on X. Then the sheaves \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) are zero for i&lt;p, and, when i=p, there is a canonical isomorphism \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathfrak{J}},{\\mathscr{L}})) \\tag{3.7} where {\\mathfrak{J}} denotes an arbitrary sheaf of ideals on X that annihilates {\\mathscr{F}} and has Y as its set of zeros. In particular, if {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent algebraic sheaf on Y, then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_Y}({\\mathscr{F}},\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,{\\mathscr{L}})). \\tag{3.7 bis} Finally, with {\\mathscr{F}} still a coherent algebraic sheaf on Y, the sheaves {\\mathscr{E}}^i=\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{p+i}({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) do not depend on the choice of immersion of the algebraic space Y into the non-singular algebraic variety X. Proof. Since the question is local, we can assume that X is affine and that {\\mathscr{L}}={\\mathscr{O}}_X. This then reduces to a problem of commutative algebra, and, more specifically, of local algebra: if A is a regular locality, and M an A-module whose support is of dimension \\leqslant q=n-p, then we have to prove that \\operatorname{Ext}_A^i(M,A)=0 for i&lt;p and that \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(M,A)=\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M,\\operatorname{Ext}^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},A)), where {\\mathfrak{J}} is an arbitrary ideal of “dimension” \\leqslant q that annihilates M. For the first claim, we proceed by induction on q: an immediate dévissage leads to the case where M is of the form A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, and thus leads, by replacing {\\mathfrak{J}} with a smaller ideal and using the induction hypothesis, as well as the exact sequence of the \\operatorname{Ext}, to the case where {\\mathfrak{J}} is generated by a “system of parameters”, as in Proposition 4, where the result is immediate. The previous result implies that, if {\\mathfrak{J}} is a fixed ideal of “dimension” \\leqslant q, then the contravariant functor E(M)=\\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(M,A) to the category of (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-modules is left exact; furthermore, it sends direct sums to direct products, from which it easily follows that E(M)=\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M,E(A)). Finally, the last claim of Proposition 5 is more subtle, and follows from an intrinsic characterisation of the E^i(F) via a local duality theorem which cannot be stated here. Denote by \\omega_Y^q the sheaf \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^n). Then there is a functorial isomorphism for coherent algebraic sheaves {\\mathscr{F}} on Y: \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_Y^q). \\tag{3.8} 4. Cohomology class associated to a subvariety In all that follows, X denotes an algebraic set of dimension n, defined over a field k that we assume, for simplicity, to be algebraically closed. Except for in §6, we assume that X is non-singular. We denote by {\\mathscr{O}}_X the structure sheaf of X, and by \\Omega_X^\\bullet=\\bigcup_p\\Omega_X^p the sheaf of germs of differential forms on X. If Y is a closed subset of X, then we identify coherent algebraic sheaves on Y with coherent algebraic sheaves on X that are zero outside of Y; we do this, in particular, with {\\mathscr{O}}_Y and \\Omega_Y. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X whose support is of dimension \\leqslant n-p, and let {\\mathscr{L}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X that is locally free. Then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) is zero for i&lt;p, and there is a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}})). \\tag{4.1} If {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent algebraic sheaf on a closed subset W of X of dimension \\leqslant n-p, then we have a canonical isomorphism \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'\\otimes\\Omega_X^n,\\omega_Y^{n-p}) \\tag{4.1 bis} where \\omega_Y^{n-p} is the sheaf on Y defined in the corollary to Proposition 5 (which can be identified with \\Omega_Y^{n-p} if Y is non-singular). Proof. The formula in (4.1) is an immediate consequence of the spectral sequence from Proposition 1, as well as Proposition 5; by the formula in (3.8), we can write \\begin{gathered} \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = {\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes(\\Omega_X^n)'\\otimes\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\\\= {\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes(\\Omega_X^n)'\\otimes\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_Y^q) \\\\= \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'\\otimes\\Omega_X^n,\\omega_Y^q) \\end{gathered} where q=n-p, whence the formula in (4.1 bis). Setting, in particular, {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_Y and {\\mathscr{L}}=\\Omega_X^p, we obtain (taking into account the fact that \\Omega_X^n\\otimes(\\Omega_X^p)'=\\Omega_X^{n-p}) a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) = \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;\\Omega_X^{n-p},\\omega_Y^{n-p}). \\tag{4.2} Now suppose, for simplicity, that Y is non-singular, so that \\omega_Y^{n-p}=\\Omega_Y^{n-p}. There is a natural homomorphism from \\Omega_X^{n-p} to \\Omega_Y^{n-p}, whence a canonical section s_Y of the sheaf \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p), that we call, if all the components of Y are of dimension n-p, the fundamental section of the sheaf \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p). By (4.1), this section defines an element of \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p). But the natural homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_Y defines a homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^p) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p). We thus obtain an element of \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p), denoted by P_X(Y), that we call the cohomology class of Y in X; it is induced by the section s_Y of \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) by the following diagram of homomorphisms: \\begin{CD} \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p)) \\\\@VVV \\\\\\begin{gathered} \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^y) \\\\=\\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p) \\end{gathered} \\end{CD} \\tag{4.3} We define a non-singular cycle of dimension n-p to be any element of the free abelian group generated by the non-singular irreducible subvarieties of dimension n-p in X. Then the function Y\\mapsto P(Y) can be extended to a homomorphism from the group of non-singular cycles of dimension n-p on X to the group \\operatorname{H}^p*X,\\Omega_X^p). Let Z^{n-p} and Z'^{n-p'} be non-singular cycles of dimension n-p and n-p' (respectively); we say that they intersect transversally if every component of Z intersects transversally with every component of Z'. Then the cycle Z\\cdot Z' is defined, and is a non-singular cycle of dimension n-p-p'. With this, we have: If Z^{n-p} and Z'^{n-p'} are non-singular cycles that intersect transversally, then P_X(Z\\cdot Z') = P_X(Z)\\cdot P_X(Z') \\tag{4.4} where the product on the right-hand side is the cup product: \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p)\\times\\operatorname{H}^{p'}(X,\\Omega_X^{p'}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^{p+p'}(X,\\Omega_X^{p+p'}). (We assume that X is isomorphic to a locally closed subset of a projective space). This last hypothesis is used only to be able to conclude that every coherent algebraic sheaf on X is a quotient of a locally-free coherent algebraic sheaf (Serre) and thus admits a left resolution by locally-free sheaves. Proof. To prove Theorem 1, we can assume that Z and Z' are irreducible non-singular subvarieties Y and Y' that intersect transversally. Let {\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet be a left resolution of {\\mathscr{O}}_Y by locally-free sheaves; then, by Proposition 3, the diagram of homomorphisms in (4.3) can be identified with the diagram \\begin{CD} (\\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma)\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big) @&gt;\\beta&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^p\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big)\\big) \\\\@V\\alpha VV . \\\\(\\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma)(\\Omega_X^p) \\end{CD} where \\beta is an isomorphism, and where \\Gamma is the “group of sections” functor on the category of abelian sheaves on X, \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma is its hypercohomology in dimension p, and \\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma is its p-th derived functor. For simplicity, we assume that {\\mathscr{L}}_0={\\mathscr{O}}_X, and that the augmentation {\\mathscr{L}}_0\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_Y is the natural homomorphism (which we can indeed safely assume); then \\alpha is induced by the homomorphism of complexes {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to{\\mathscr{L}} (with {\\mathscr{O}}_X being thought of as a complex concentrated in degree 0), taking into account the fact that \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma({\\mathscr{K}})=\\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma({\\mathscr{K}}_0) if {\\mathscr{K}} is a complex of sheaves concentrated in degree 0. The homomorphism \\beta is a well-known “boundary map”. Consider an analogous diagram, relative to a locally-free resolution {\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet of {\\mathscr{O}}_Y, and consider the commutative diagram of pairings: \\scriptsize \\begin{CD} \\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma(\\Omega_X^p) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^p\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big)\\big) \\\\@. @. @. \\\\\\times @. \\times @. \\times \\\\@. @. @. \\\\\\operatorname{R}^{p'}\\Gamma(\\Omega_X^{p'}) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^{p'}\\Gamma\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p'})\\big) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^{p'}\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p'})\\big)\\big) \\\\@VVV @VVV @VVV \\\\\\operatorname{R}^{p+p'}\\Gamma(\\Omega_X^{p+p'}) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^{p+p'}\\Gamma\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p+p'})\\big) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^{p+p'}\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p+p'})\\big)\\big) \\end{CD} \\tag{4.5} The pairings in the two columns on the right are induced by the pairing of complexes of sheaves \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p) \\times \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p'}) \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}',\\Omega_X^{p+p'}) that we define by using the exterior product \\Omega_X^p\\times\\Omega_X^{p'}\\to\\Omega_X^{p+p'}; the pairing in the first column is the cup product (relative to the exterior product). I claim that the last line of (4.5) can be identified with the diagram of isomorphisms analogous to (4.3), where Y is replaced by Y\\cap Y' and p by p+p'. For this, it suffices to show that {\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' is a resolution (evidently locally-free) of {\\mathscr{O}}_{Y\\cap Y'}. But then \\operatorname{H}_0({\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}') = {\\mathscr{O}}_Y\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'} = {\\mathscr{O}}_{Y\\cap Y'} and \\operatorname{H}_i({\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}') = \\operatorname{Tor}_i^{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,{\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'}) = 0 for i&gt;0, from the fact that Y and Y' intersect transversally. Then Theorem 1 follows from the formula: s_{Y}\\cdot s_{Y'} = s_{Y\\cdot Y'} \\tag{4.6} (where the product on the left-hand side is that from the last column of (4.5)). This formula in (4.6), which is of a purely local nature, can easily be proven by taking {\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet and {\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet to be the resolutions described in Proposition 4. We can similarly prove (even more easily) that Z\\mapsto P_X(Z) is compatible with the cartesian product: P_{X\\times X'}(Z\\times Z') = P_X(Z)\\otimes P_{X'}(Z') \\tag{4.7} (a formula which holds true if Z (resp. Z') is a non-singular cycle on the non-singular variety X (resp. X'), with Z\\times Z' being thought of as a non-singular cycle on X\\times X'). From (4.4) and (4.7), it follows that P_X(Z) is also compatible with the operation given by taking the “inverse image” under a morphism f\\colon X\\to X' of non-singular varieties: P_X(f^{-1}(Z')) = f^*(P_{X'}(Z)) \\tag{4.8} a formula which holds true if Z is a non-singular cycle on X' such that f is “transversal” to Z, i.e. such that the graph of f is transversal to the cycle X\\times Z' in X\\times X'. Let X and X' be non-singular varieties that are locally-closed in a projective space, and suppose that X' is complete. Let U be a non-singular cycle on X\\times X', and let a and b be points of X' such that U intersects transversally with the cycles X\\times(a) and X\\times(b). Let Z and Z' be non-singular cycles on X such that Z\\times(a)=(X\\times(a))\\cdot U and Z\\times(b)=(X\\times(b))\\cdot U. Then P_X(Z) = P_X(Z'). Proof. Let f_a\\colon X\\to X\\times X' be defined by f_a(x)=(x,a). Then, by (4.8), we have P(Z)=f_a^*(P(U)); similarly, P(Z')=f_b^*(P(U)). But then, using the Künneth formula \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X\\times X',\\Omega_{X\\times X'}^\\bullet) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X,\\Omega_X^\\bullet)\\otimes\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X',\\Omega_{X'}^\\bullet) and the fact that \\operatorname{H}^0(X',\\Omega_{X'}) is simply the scalars, we easily see that f_a^*=f_b^*, whence the result. For all x\\in X, (x) is a non-singular subvariety of X of codimension n, and thus defines an element \\varepsilon_x of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). If X is a non-singular projective variety, then it follows from the above Corollary 1 that \\varepsilon_x does not depend on the chosen point x, and we thus denote it by \\varepsilon_X and call it the fundamental class of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). To have a satisfying theory, we must define P_X(Z) for arbitrary cycles Z, and prove Theorem 1 for proper intersections of cycles. (At the time of writing this talk, this has still not been done in full generality). Assuming that we have done this, the above Corollary 1 becomes the following: if Z and Z' are two algebraically-equivalent cycles, then P_X(Z)=P_X(Z') (a claim which does not seem to follow from the above, even if Z and Z' are non-singular). [Comp.] As I pointed out in my conference at the international Congress of Mathematicians in 19582, the questions raised here are now completely resolved. The reader will find more information on the duality of coherent sheaves in loco citato, p. 112–115, as well as in EGA III.2, and in SGA (1962). A more systematic treatment can be found in a later chapter of EGA (chapter IX in the provisional plan). 5. The duality theorem In this section, X denotes a non-singular projective variety of dimension n. The fundamental class \\varepsilon_X of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) is a basis of this vector space. (The proof of this will be given later on). With the above theorem, we can thus identify \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) with the field k. We now consider the pairings described in §2, which give, in particular, a pairing \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,{\\mathscr{F}})\\times\\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^n) i.e. \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}})\\times\\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). \\tag{5.1} Taking Theorem 2 into account, this pairing defines a homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to (\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}))'. \\tag{5.2} This homomorphism is functorial in {\\mathscr{F}}, and commutes with the coboundary maps relative to the exact sequences 0\\to{\\mathscr{F}}'\\to{\\mathscr{F}}\\to{\\mathscr{F}}''\\to0. The homomorphism in (5.2) is an isomorphism. In particular, we recover the following result of Serre: Let E be an algebraic vector bundle on X, and {\\mathscr{O}}_X(E) the sheaf of germs of regular sections of X. Then we have canonical isomorphisms3 (\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X(E)))' = \\operatorname{H}^{n-p}(X,\\Omega_X^n\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_X(E')). Proof. It suffices to apply Theorem 3 and Corollary 1 of Proposition 1. Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 will follow from the following claim: The homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to (\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}))'\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}} \\tag{5.2 bis} (where {\\mathscr{L}}=\\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n)) induced by the pairing in (5.1) is an isomorphism. We will show that (D) implies Theorem 2. Let k_x={\\mathscr{O}}_{(x)} be the structure sheaf of the variety consisting of a single point x\\in X, and consider the canonical homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to k_x, and the associated homomorphism \\operatorname{H}^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(X,k_x). \\tag{5.3} Its transpose can be identified with the homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;k_x,\\Omega_X^n)\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^n)\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' \\tag{5.4} induced by the homomorphism between the \\operatorname{Ext}^n associated to {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to k_x, i.e. \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;k_x,\\Omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^n) \\tag{5.5} Since (5.3) is an isomorphism, so too is (5.4), and thus so too is (5.5). Since s_{(x)} is a basis of \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;k_x,\\Omega_X^n) by (4.2), it indeed follows that its image \\varepsilon_X is a basis of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). It remains only to prove the statement of (D), which will follow in a purely formal way from some elementary facts summarised in the following lemmas. Here we suppose that X is a closed subset (singular or not) of the projective space \\mathbf{P} of dimension r. We use the notation {\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m) to denote the sheaf on \\mathbf{P} denoted by {\\mathscr{O}}(m) in [21], and the notation {\\mathscr{O}}_X(m) for the analogous sheaf on X. The statement of (D) is true if X=\\mathbf{P} and {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m). Proof. This lemma can be proved by a direct calculation. The explicit calculation of the \\operatorname{H}^i(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m)) can be found in [21], but it also can be done in a simpler way. Computing the cup product \\operatorname{H}^i(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m))\\times\\operatorname{H}^j(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m)') \\to \\operatorname{H}^{i+j}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m+m')) (which is necessary to calculate the pairing in (5.1)) does not present any difficulty. Every coherent algebraic sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X is isomorphic to a sheaf that is some quotient of {\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m)^k, and we can take m to be as large as we wish. Proof. This follows from the fact that {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_X(m) is “generated by its sections” for large enough m; see [21]. Let i&gt;0. Then \\operatorname{H}^{r-i}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(-m))=0 for large enough m; and, for every coherent algebra sheaf {\\mathscr{B}} on X, we have that \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m),{\\mathscr{B}})=0 for large enough m. Proof. The first claim follows from the explicit calculations mentioned above; for the second, we note that we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m),{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^i(X,{\\mathscr{B}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}(m)) (Corollary 1 of Proposition 1), whence the conclusion, by a well-known result of [21]. Combining the previous two lemmas, we find: Let i&gt;0. Then the functor {\\mathscr{F}}\\mapsto\\operatorname{H}^{r-i}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{F}}) on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on \\mathbf{P} is coeffaceable, and so too is the functor \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{B}}) on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on X. Let {\\mathscr{A}} and {\\mathscr{B}} be coherent algebraic sheaves on X, and let {\\mathscr{A}}(m)={\\mathscr{A}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_X(m). Then, for large enough m, the canonical homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i({\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}})) = \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})(m)) is an isomorphism. Proof. This follows immediately from the spectral sequence in applied to {\\mathscr{A}}(-m) and {\\mathscr{B}}, since we then have that E_2^{p,q}({\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^q({\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}})) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^q({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})(m)) which is zero for p&gt;0 and large enough m. We now prove (D) in the case where X=\\mathbf{P}. We will first prove that (5.2 bis) is an isomorphism for p=n; since both sides are then left-exact functors (since \\operatorname{H}^{r+i}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{F}})=0), it follows from Lemma 3 that it suffices to prove the claim for {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(-m), but this is covered by Lemma 2. Since the homomorphisms in (5.2 bis) are functorial and compatible with the coboundary maps, and since, for p&lt;n, both sides of (5.2 bis) are coeffaceable functors in {\\mathscr{F}} (the corollary to Lemmas 3 and 4), it follows, by a standard argument, that (5.2 bis) is an isomorphism for all p. This proves the duality theorem for the projective space. Now suppose that X is arbitrary, but non-singular. By the duality theorem for \\mathbf{P}, we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{H}^n(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) = \\operatorname{H}^n(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{F}})' = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r). By Lemma 1, the far-right-hand side can be identified with \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^0(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) whence we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{H}^n(X,{\\mathscr{F}})' = \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^0(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n). \\tag{5.6} Taking {\\mathscr{F}}=\\Omega_X^n, we obtain an isomorphism \\eta\\colon \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) \\xrightarrow{\\sim} k. \\tag{5.7} We can prove that the isomorphism in (5.6) is exactly (5.2 bis) with p=n and {\\mathscr{L}}=k, by (5.7). Subsequently, (5.2 bis) is an isomorphism for p=n. To prove that it is an isomorphism for all p, it again suffices to prove that, for p&lt;n, the two sides of (5.2 bis) are coeffaceable functors in {\\mathscr{F}}, and, a fortiori (taking Lemma 3 into account), that the two sides are zero when we take {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m) with large enough m. But, for the left-hand side, this is true by Lemma 4, and for the right-hand side we can write, using the duality theorem for \\mathbf{P}, \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m))' = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-p}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m),\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r). The right-hand side is zero for p&lt;n and large enough m, as follows from Lemma 5 (where in fact X=\\mathbf{P}) and from the fact that {\\mathscr{O}}_X is of cohomological dimension \\leqslant r-n when thought of as a coherent algebraic sheaf on \\mathbf{P} (since X is non-singular), whence \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-p}({\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r) = 0 \\quad\\text{for }p&lt;n. 6. The duality theorem for singular varieties Let X be a closed subset of dimension n of the projective space \\mathbf{P} of dimension r. Equation (5.6) can then be written as \\operatorname{H}^n(X,{\\mathscr{F}})' \\simeq \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^0(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) \\tag{6.1} where we set4 \\omega_X^n = E^0({\\mathscr{O}}_X) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n}({\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r). As mentioned in Proposition 5, the sheaf thus defined does not depend on the chosen immersion of X into the non-singular variety \\mathbf{P}. Taking {\\mathscr{F}}=\\omega_X^n in (6.1), we find that \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\omega_X^n)' \\simeq \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;\\omega_X^n,\\omega_X^n) \\tag{6.2} whence the existence of a distinguished element in \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\omega_X^n), corresponding to the identity morphism from \\omega_X^n to itself: \\eta\\colon \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) \\to k. \\tag{6.3} Then consider the pairings defined by the composition of the \\operatorname{Ext}: \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) \\times \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\omega_X^n) \\tag{6.4} and compose them with the homomorphism \\eta in (6.3); we thus obtain functorial homomorphisms \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}})' \\tag{6.5} which are compatible with the boundary maps (generalising (5.2)). We can prove that, for p=n, we thus obtain the isomorphism in (6.1). With this, we have: For any given integer k\\geqslant 0, the four following conditions on X are equivalent: The functorial homomorphism in (6.5) is an isomorphism for n-k\\leqslant p\\leqslant n. \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m)) = 0 for n-k\\leqslant p&lt;n and large enough m. The functor \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on X is coeffaceable for n-k\\leqslant p&lt;n. E^i({\\mathscr{O}}_X) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n+i}({\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\omega_\\mathbf{P}^r) = 0 for 0&lt;i\\leqslant k. Proof. i.\\impliesii. by Lemma 4; ii.\\impliesiii. by Lemma 3; iii.\\impliesi. by a well-known standard argument, taking into account the fact that the two sides of (6.5) are then coeffaceable functors for n-k\\leqslant p&lt; n (the first being so by Lemma 4); finally, ii.\\iffiv. follows from the corollary to the following proposition. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X, and let i be an integer. Then, for large enough m, we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{H}^i(X,{\\mathscr{F}}(-m))' \\simeq \\operatorname{H}^0(X,E^{n-i}({\\mathscr{F}})(m)) \\tag{6.6} where we set E^j({\\mathscr{F}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n+j}({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r) \\tag{6.7} (compare with Proposition 5 in §3). Proof. Indeed, by the duality theorem for \\mathbf{P}, the left-hand side of (6.6) is isomorphic to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-i}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{F}}(-m),\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r), and so (6.6) follows from Lemma 5. For \\operatorname{H}^i(X,{\\mathscr{F}}(-m)) to be zero for large enough m, it is necessary and sufficient for E^{n-i}({\\mathscr{F}}) to be zero. Recall that the E^j({\\mathscr{F}}) do not depend on the projective immersion in question. The condition of the corollary is purely local, and so, if it is satisfied for {\\mathscr{F}}, then it is also satisfied for every sheaf that is locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{F}}^n. In particular, if this condition is satisfied for {\\mathscr{O}}_X, then it is satisfied for every locally-free coherent algebraic sheaf. This is the case, for example, for all i&lt;n if X is non-singular; and for i=0 if no component of X consists of a single point; and for i=0,1 if S is normal and all its components are of dimension &gt;1 (see [21]). For it to be satisfied for i&lt;k, it is necessary and sufficient, by definition, for the local rings {\\mathscr{O}}_x (x\\in X) to be of “homological codimension \\geqslant k” (see [22] for details on this notion). If k=n, then this implies, by Theorem 3 bis, that the duality theorem is true for X, i.e. that (6.5) is an isomorphism for all p and for all {\\mathscr{F}}. We can give many equivalent conditions on the local rings {\\mathscr{O}}_x for this to be the case (Nagata); for example, those that satisfy the Cohen-Macaulay equidimensionality theorem. It is also the case, for example, if X is locally a “complete intersection” in a non-singular ambient variety. 7. Poincaré duality Let X be a non-singular projective variety of dimension n.

Only the theory of moderately ramified coverings (cf. Theorem 14) has not yet been the subject of a dedicated talk. The corollary to Theorem 14, which completely determines Galois coverings of order coprime to the characteristic of an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field, has been used in an essential manner on three separate occasions: in the proof by Igusa of the Picard inequality for non-singular projective surfaces in arbitrary characteristic; in the study (developed independently by Ogg and Šafarevič) of the group of homogeneous principal bundles over an abelian variety defined over a function field in one variable, in arbitrary characteristic; and in the recent proof, by Artin, of certain key theorems concerning the “Weil cohomology” of algebraic varieties. 1.

TO-DO: additif errata Introduction The techniques described in [8] were, for the most part, independent of any projective hypotheses on the schemes in question. Unfortunately, they have not as of yet allowed us to solve the existence problems posed in [8]. In the current exposé, and the following, we will solve these problems by imposing projective hypotheses. The techniques used are typically projective, and practically make no use of any results from [8]. Here we will construct “Hilbert schemes”, which are meant to replace the use of Chow coordinates, as was mentioned in [8]. In the next exposé, the theory of passing to the quotient in schemes, developed in [8], combined with the theory of Hilbert schemes, will allow us, for example, to construct Picard schemes (defined in [8]) under rather general conditions. In summary, we can say that we now have a more or less satisfying technique of projective constructions, apart from the fact that we are still missing5 a theory of passing to the quotient by groups such as the projective group, acting “without fixed points” (cf. [8]). The situation even seems slightly better in analytic geometry (if we restrict to the study of “projective” analytic spaces over a given analytic space), since, for analytic spaces, the difficulty of passing to the quotient by a group that acts nicely disappears. Either way, in algebraic geometry, as well as in analytic geometry, it remains to develop a construction technique that works without any projective hypotheses. 1. Bounded sets of sheaves: invariance properties Let k be a field, and X a k-prescheme (which we take to be of finite type, for simplicity). For every extension K/k, we obtain a K-prescheme X_K=X\\otimes_k K. If {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent sheaf on X_K, and if K' is an extension of K, then {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes_K K'={\\mathscr{F}}_{K'} is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X_K\\otimes_KK'=X_{K'}. So, if K and K' are arbitrary extensions of k, and {\\mathscr{F}} a quasi-coherent sheaf on X_K and {\\mathscr{F}}' a quasi-coherent sheaf on X_{K'}, then we say that {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{F}}' are equivalent if there exists an extension K\"/k as well as k-homomorphisms K\\to K\" and K'\\to K\" such that {\\mathscr{F}}_{K\"} and {\\mathscr{F}}'_{K\"} are isomorphic on X_{K\"} (TO-DO: ? is this right?). This defines an equivalence relation, and we are interested in the equivalence classes of sheaves under this relation, and of sets of such equivalence classes. Note that, if X_0 is of finite type over k, then every class of coherent sheaves can be defined by a coherent sheaf on X_K, where K is some extension of k of finite type. We can thus, in the definition of classes of coherent sheaves, restrict ourselves to algebraically closed extensions of k, and we can also restrict ourselves to a fixed algebraically closed extension \\Omega of k, of infinite transcendence degree; two coherent sheaves {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{F}}' on X_\\Omega are then equivalent if and only if there exists a K-automorphism \\sigma of \\Omega such that {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes_K(\\Omega,\\sigma) is isomorphic to {\\mathscr{F}}'. Note that there is a bijective correspondence between classes of coherent sheaves under the first definition and under the second. Let E and E' be two sets of classes of coherent sheaves on X. Consider the classes of all sheaves of the form {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{F}}', where {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{F}}' are coherent sheaves on the same X_K, with the class of {\\mathscr{F}} being in E and the class of {\\mathscr{F}}' being in E'. We thus define a set of classes of coherent sheaves that we denote by E\\otimes E'. We can similarly define \\underline{\\operatorname{Tor}}_i(E,E'), etc. References "],["FGA-3-V.html", "3:V — Picard schemes: Existence theorems", " 3:V — Picard schemes: Existence theorems Grothendieck, A. “Technique de descente et théorèmes d’existence en géométrie algébrique, V: Les schémas de Picard: Théorèmes d’existence”.
