[["index.html", "Foundations of Algebraic Geometry Foreword", " Foundations of Algebraic Geometry A. Grothendieck 1957–1962 !! TO-DO: translator’s note !! mention bibliography numbering changes Version: GIT_COMMIT_HASH_VARIABLE Foreword In the Séminaire Bourbaki, between 1957 and 1962, we gave eight exposés on the foundations of algebraic geometry. With the exception of the first, these exposés are expressed in the language of schemes. All of the stated results will find their place in Jean Dieudonné and Alexander Grothendieck’s “Éléments de géométrie algébrique”. However, none of the essence of any of these exposés is currently found in any of the chapters (neither published nor still in preperation) of the EGA, nor in any other book or article, and this will probably remain the case for a few more years still. This is the main reason that persuaded us to combine these exposés, giving readers access to a number of ideas and key results of the theory of schemes whilst awaiting a well-written summary. Also, reading these chapters will allow the reader to quickly familiarise themselves with the aforementioned results and ideas, without being bothered by the necessarily cumbersome details of a systematic treatment, and also endow them with vital motivations for the study of such a treatment. For the sake of the reader, we have assembled here some comments and errata, grouped by exposé, that, most notably, show the progress accomplished since the editing of this text, as well as indicating some supplementary references.1 Many of the results appearing in these exposés have been discussed in detail in the Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie, as well as in the two subsequent seminars at Harvard, in 1961–62 (the first by myself, and the second by Mumford–Tate), the notes for which are currently in preparation by Lichtenbaum. [Trans.] Rather than translating the comments and errata here, we have inserted them throughout the text in the relevant places; we preface them with “[Comp.]” (except for small corrections, which we insert silently).↩︎ "],["FGA-1.html", "1 Duality theorems for coherent algebraic sheaves [FGA 1] 1.1 \\operatorname{Ext} of sheaves of modules 1.2 The composition law in \\operatorname{Ext} 1.3 Results concerning local cohomology 1.4 Cohomology class associated to a subvariety 1.5 The duality theorem 1.6 The duality theorem for singular varieties 1.7 Poincaré duality 1.8 Generalisation of the duality theorem", " 1 Duality theorems for coherent algebraic sheaves [FGA 1] Grothendieck, A. “Théorème de dualité pour les faisceaux algébriques cohérents”. Séminaire Bourbaki 9 (1956–57), Talk no. 149. The results that follow, inspired by Serre’s “theorem of algebraic duality”, were discovered in the winter of 1955 and the winter of 1956. They can be established very simply, thanks to reasonably elementary results on the cohomology of projective spaces [21] and an intensive use of Cartan–Eilenberg’s homological algebra, in the form given in [7]. 1.1 \\operatorname{Ext} of sheaves of modules (cf. [7], chap. 3 and 4) Let X be a topological space endowed with a sheaf {\\mathscr{O}} of unital (but not necessarily commutative) rings. We consider the abelian category {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} of sheaves of {\\mathscr{O}}-modules, which are also referred to as {\\mathscr{O}}-modules. We know that every object of this category admits an injective resolution, which allows us to define the \\operatorname{Ext} functors that have the well-known formal properties. More precisely, to avoid confusion, we denote by \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}), or simply \\operatorname{Hom}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}), the abelian groups of {\\mathscr{O}}-homomorphisms from {\\mathscr{A}} to {\\mathscr{B}}, whereas \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) denotes the sheaf of germs of homomorphisms from {\\mathscr{A}} to {\\mathscr{B}} (where {\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}\\in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}). We define, for fixed {\\mathscr{A}}\\in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}, functors h_{\\mathscr{A}} and \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}, with values in the category {\\mathcal{C}} of abelian groups and the category {\\mathcal{C}}^Z of abelian sheaves on X (respectively), by the formulas: \\begin{aligned} h_{\\mathscr{A}}({\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\\\\\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}({\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}). \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1} The functors h_{\\mathscr{A}} and \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}} are left exact and covariant, and so we consider their right-derived functors, denoted by \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) and \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) (respectively). We then have, by definition, \\begin{gathered} \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p h_{\\mathscr{A}})({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}}))) \\\\\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}})({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}}))) \\end{gathered} \\tag{1.2} where \\operatorname{R}^p denotes the passage to right-derived functors, and where C({\\mathscr{B}}) denotes an arbitrary injective resolution of {\\mathscr{B}} in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}. We denote by \\Gamma\\colon{\\mathcal{C}}^Z\\to{\\mathcal{C}} the “sections” functor; recall that its right-derived functors are denoted by B\\mapsto\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}): \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma)({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\Gamma(C({\\mathscr{B}}))). \\tag{1.3} We evidently have h_{\\mathscr{A}}=\\Gamma\\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}; we can also show that \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}} sends injective objects to \\Gamma-acyclic objects. From this, it is a well-known result that: For every {\\mathscr{O}}-module {\\mathscr{A}}, there exists a cohomological spectral functor on {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} that abuts to the graded functor (\\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^\\bullet(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})), and whose initial page is E_2^{p,q}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})). \\tag{1.4} From this, we obtain “boundary homomorphisms”, as well as a short exact sequence, which we will not write. If {\\mathscr{A}} is locally isomorphic to {\\mathscr{O}}^n, then we have canonical isomorphisms \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\xleftarrow{\\sim} \\operatorname{H}^p(x,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\tag{1.5} (given by the boundary homomorphisms of the spectral sequence). In particular, we have a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}). \\tag{1.6} To use these results, we need to know how to explicitly describe the \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}). They are functors that we calculate locally, i.e. if V is an open subset of X, then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})|U = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}|U}^p({\\mathscr{A}}|U,{\\mathscr{B}}|U), as follows from the fact that the restriction to U of an injective {\\mathscr{O}}-module is an injective ({\\mathscr{O}}|U)-module. Furthermore, for fixed x\\in X, we have functorial homomorphisms \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})_x \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_x}({\\mathscr{A}}_x,{\\mathscr{B}}_x) \\tag{1.7} that uniquely extend to homomorphisms of cohomological functors (in {\\mathscr{B}}): \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})_x \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_x}^p({\\mathscr{A}}_x,{\\mathscr{B}}_x). \\tag{1.8} If {\\mathscr{A}} is isomorphic, in a neighbourhood of x, to the cokernel of some homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}^m\\to{\\mathscr{O}}^n, then (1.7) is an isomorphism for all p. This is the case, in particular, if {\\mathscr{A}} is a coherent {\\mathscr{O}}-module [21]. Let {\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet=({\\mathscr{L}}_i) be a left resolution of the {\\mathscr{O}}-module {\\mathscr{A}} by {\\mathscr{O}}-modules that are all locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{O}}^n. Then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) can be identified with \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}})), and \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) can be identified with the hypercohomology of X with respect to the complex \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}}). Proof. The proof is standard: we consider the bicomplex \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,C({\\mathscr{B}})), where C({\\mathscr{B}}) is an injective resolution of {\\mathscr{B}}, as well as the natural homomorphisms into this bicomplex from \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}}) and \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}})). } To finish, we note that the two \\operatorname{Ext} functors introduced in (1.2) are not only cohomological functors in {\\mathscr{B}}, but in fact cohomological bifunctors, covariant in {\\mathscr{B}}, and contravariant in {\\mathscr{A}}. 1.2 The composition law in \\operatorname{Ext} The results of this section are due, independently, to Cartier and Yoneda; see a talk by Cartier [2] for more details. Let {\\mathcal{C}} be an abelian category, and let K and L be two graded objects of {\\mathcal{C}}. We denote by \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L) the graded abelian group whose degree-n component consists of homogeneous homomorphisms of degree n from K to L (i.e. systems (u_i) of homomorphisms K^i\\to L^{i+n}). If K and L are complexes (with differentials of degree +1, to fix conventions), then we endow \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L) with the differential operator given by \\delta(u) = \\mathrm{d}u + (-1)^{n+1}u\\mathrm{d} \\quad\\text{where }n=\\deg(u) \\tag{2.1} which makes it a complex with a differential of degree +1. The cycles of degree n are the maps of degree n that anticommute with u (as homogeneous maps). We can then consider \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(K,L)), which is an invariant of the homotopy types of K and L, and which we sometimes denote by \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L). If we have a third complex M, then the composition of homomorphisms defines a pairing \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L)\\times\\operatorname{Hom}(L,M)\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(K,M) which is compatible with the differential maps, whence, by passing to the cohomology of pairings, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L)\\times\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(L,M) \\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,M) \\tag{2.2} which we write as (u,v)\\mapsto vu. These pairings satisfy an evident associativity property; in particular, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,K) is an associative graded unital ring, and \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L) (resp. \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(L,K)) is a graded right (resp. left) module over this ring, etc. In dimension 0, (2.2) reduces to the composition of permissible homomorphisms of complexes. Finally, an exact sequence of complexes 0\\to K'\\to K\\to K''\\to0 such that, for all i, K'^i can be identified with a direct factor of K^i, gives rise to an exact sequence of complexes of groups \\operatorname{Hom}(K'',L), etc., whence a coboundary map \\operatorname{H}^i(K',L)\\to\\operatorname{H}^{i+1}(K'',L). We similarly define the boundary maps relative to an exact sequence in L. The pairings in (2.2) are compatible, in the usual sense, with these coboundary maps. Now suppose that {\\mathcal{C}} is a category such that every element A of {\\mathcal{C}} admits an injective resolution C(A). We then note that, using one of the many variants of the theorem of bicomplexes, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(C(A),C(B)) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(C(A),C(B))) is canonically isomorphic to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(A,C(B))) = \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,B). The coboundary maps described above give coboundary maps of the \\operatorname{Ext}. Furthermore, the pairings in (2.2) give associative pairings here: \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,B)\\times\\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(B,C) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,C) \\tag{2.3} and these are compatible with the coboundary maps. In particular, \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,A) is an associative graded unital ring, etc. (We can show in an analogous manner that the \\operatorname{Ext} functors behave like derived functors of an arbitrary functor; we do not make use of this fact here). In the case where the category in question is the category {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} of {\\mathscr{O}}-modules on X, we then obtain pairings \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})\\times\\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q(X;{\\mathscr{B}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^{p+q}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\tag{2.4} that can be calculated as already described. The same method, but replacing the category of abelian groups with the category of abelian sheaves on X, and the \\operatorname{Hom} functors by the \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}} functors, again defines pairings, having the same formal properties, and of a “local nature” this time: \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})\\times\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q({\\mathscr{B}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^{p+q}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{C}}). \\tag{2.5} These can be understood by noting that the homomorphisms in (1.8) are compatible with the pairings between the \\operatorname{Ext}. Finally, recall that we also have a multiplicative structure between functors \\operatorname{H}^p(X,A), namely the cup product. We note then that the spectral sequences of Proposition 1 are compatible with the multiplicative structures; more precisely, we have a pairing from the spectral sequence E(A,B) with the spectral sequence E(B,C) to the spectral sequence E(A,C) that abuts to the pairing between the global \\operatorname{Ext}, and whose initial page comes from the cup product and the local \\operatorname{Ext} pairings in the right-hand side of (1.4). It then follows, in particular, that the “boundary homomorphisms” \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(X;\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\tag{2.6} \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\tag{2.7} are compatible with the multiplicative structures. So, if we restrict to sheaves that are locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{O}}^m, then this completely explains the composition of the global \\operatorname{Ext} by means of the cup product, taking into account the isomorphisms of (1.5). 1.3 Results concerning local cohomology Let A be a unital commutative ring endowed with an ideal {\\mathfrak{J}}. We will define, for any A-module M, functorial homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{Hom}_A(\\wedge^p{\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2,M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) \\\\\\operatorname{Tor}_p^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\leftarrow(\\wedge^p{\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2)\\otimes\\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.1} where the tensor and exterior products are taken over the ring A; note also that {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2 is in fact an A/{\\mathfrak{J}}-module, and that its exterior powers as an A-module agree with its exterior powers as an A/{\\mathfrak{J}}-module. The definition of the homomorphisms in (3.1) come from the definition, for every system x=(x_1,\\ldots,x_p) of points of {\\mathfrak{J}}, of homomorphisms \\varphi_x given by \\begin{aligned} \\varphi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}} \\\\\\varphi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{Tor}_p^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.2} such that the following conditions are satisfied: \\varphi_{x_1,\\ldots,x_p} depends on the system of the x_i\\in{\\mathfrak{J}} in an alternating A-multilinear way; \\varphi_{x_1,\\ldots,x_p} is zero when any of the x_i is in {\\mathfrak{J}}^2. In fact, ii. follows from i., since a\\varphi_x=0 for a\\in{\\mathfrak{J}}, as we see by noting that all the modules in (3.2) are annihilated by {\\mathfrak{J}}. To define the \\varphi_x, we consider the complex K_x whose underlying A-modules are the \\wedge A^p, and whose differential is the interior product i_x by x, considered as a linear form on A^p with components x_1,\\ldots,x_p. The differential is of degree -1, the degrees of the complex are positive, and the cohomology of this complex in dimension 0 is A/(x_1A+\\ldots+x_pA). Since the x_i are in {\\mathfrak{J}}, we obtain an augmentation K_{x,0}\\to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. Thus K_x is a free augmented complex, with augmentation module A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. We thus obtain known homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Ext}_A^\\bullet(\\operatorname{H}_0(K_x),M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) \\\\\\operatorname{Tor}_\\bullet^A(\\operatorname{H}_0(K_x),M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{H}_\\bullet(K_x\\otimes M) \\end{aligned} whence, by composing with the homomorphisms to the \\operatorname{Ext} and the \\operatorname{Tor} induced by the augmentation homomorphism \\operatorname{H}_0(K_x)\\to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, we obtain homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\psi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Ext}_A^\\bullet(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) \\\\\\psi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Tor}_\\bullet^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{H}_\\bullet(K_x\\otimes M). \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.3} But we immediately note that, in the maximal dimension p, the cohomology of the right-hand side is M(x_1M+\\ldots+x_pM) (resp. the set of elements of M that are annihilated by each of the x_i). Since the x_i are in {\\mathfrak{J}}, we thus obtain homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{H}^p(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) &amp;\\to M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}} \\\\\\operatorname{H}_p(K_x\\otimes M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M). \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.4} By composing the homomorphisms in (3.3) and (3.4) we obtain the homomorphisms in (3.2) that we wanted to define. The verification of i. is tedious, but does not present any difficulties. Let A be a commutative unital ring, and let (x_1,\\ldots,x_p) be a sequence of elements of A such that, for 1\\leqslant i\\leqslant p, the image of x_i in the quotient of A by the ideal generated by (x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1}) is not a zero divisor. Let {\\mathfrak{J}} be the ideal generated by the x_i. Then {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2 is a free (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module, with basis given by the canonical images of the x_i; the complex K_x is a free resolution of A/{\\mathfrak{J}}; and, for every A-modules M, the homomorphisms in (3.1) in dimension p are bijective. The same is true for the analogous homomorphisms defined for arbitrary degree i as long as {\\mathfrak{J}}\\cdot M=0. (The essential point, from which all others follow, is the acyclicity of K_x, which is a well-known fact, under the conditions given). With A and {\\mathfrak{J}} as above, suppose further that A is a regular affine algebra of \\dim n over a perfect field k, and that A/{\\mathfrak{J}} is a regular affine algebra. Denote by \\Omega^i(A) and \\Omega^i(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) the modules of Kähler differentials. Then we have a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(\\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}),\\Omega^n(A)) = A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. \\tag{3.5} which is compatible with localisation. Proof. Indeed, \\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) is a free (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module of rank 1, and, similarly, \\Omega^n(A) is a free A-module of rank n, and so the left-hand side is equal to \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},A) \\otimes \\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}})' \\otimes \\Omega^n(A) (where the “'” notation denotes the dual (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module). The tensor product of these last two factors can be identified with \\wedge^p({\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2), and so the whole thing can be identified with \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},\\wedge^p({\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2)), and thus, by the proposition, with \\operatorname{Hom}_A(\\wedge^p {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2,\\wedge^p {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2) i.e. to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. In particular, there is a distinguished element in \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(\\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}),\\Omega^n(A)), corresponding to the unit of A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, called the fundamental class of the ideal {\\mathfrak{J}} in A. (In fact, it can be defined under rather more general conditions). We can write Corollary 1 in a more geometric and global form: Let X be a non-singular variety over an algebraically-closed field k, Y a closed non-singular subvariety of X, {\\mathscr{O}}_X the structure sheaf of X, and {\\mathscr{O}}_Y the structure sheaf of Y, considered as a quotient sheaf of {\\mathscr{O}}_X. Let n be the dimension of X, and n-p the dimension of Y. Let \\Omega_X (resp. \\Omega_Y) be the sheaf of germs of regular differential forms on X (resp. Y). Then we have canonical isomorphisms \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(\\Omega_Y^{n-p},\\Omega_X^n) = {\\mathscr{O}}_Y \\tag{3.6} as well as \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^n) = \\Omega_Y^{n-p}. \\tag{3.6 bis} Equation (3.6 bis) can serve as the definition of \\Omega_Y^{n-p} when Y is a singular variety. More precisely: Let X be a non-singular algebraic variety of dimension n, and let Y be an algebraic subset of dimension q=n-p of X. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X with support contained in Y, and let {\\mathscr{L}} be a locally-free algebraic sheaf on X. Then the sheaves \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) are zero for i&lt;p, and, when i=p, there is a canonical isomorphism \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathfrak{J}},{\\mathscr{L}})) \\tag{3.7} where {\\mathfrak{J}} denotes an arbitrary sheaf of ideals on X that annihilates {\\mathscr{F}} and has Y as its set of zeros. In particular, if {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent algebraic sheaf on Y, then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_Y}({\\mathscr{F}},\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,{\\mathscr{L}})). \\tag{3.7 bis} Finally, with {\\mathscr{F}} still a coherent algebraic sheaf on Y, the sheaves {\\mathscr{E}}^i=\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{p+i}({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) do not depend on the choice of immersion of the algebraic space Y into the non-singular algebraic variety X. Proof. Since the question is local, we can assume that X is affine and that {\\mathscr{L}}={\\mathscr{O}}_X. This then reduces to a problem of commutative algebra, and, more specifically, of local algebra: if A is a regular locality, and M an A-module whose support is of dimension \\leqslant q=n-p, then we have to prove that \\operatorname{Ext}_A^i(M,A)=0 for i&lt;p and that \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(M,A)=\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M,\\operatorname{Ext}^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},A)), where {\\mathfrak{J}} is an arbitrary ideal of “dimension” \\leqslant q that annihilates M. For the first claim, we proceed by induction on q: an immediate dévissage leads to the case where M is of the form A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, and thus leads, by replacing {\\mathfrak{J}} with a smaller ideal and using the induction hypothesis, as well as the exact sequence of the \\operatorname{Ext}, to the case where {\\mathfrak{J}} is generated by a “system of parameters”, as in Proposition 4, where the result is immediate. The previous result implies that, if {\\mathfrak{J}} is a fixed ideal of “dimension” \\leqslant q, then the contravariant functor E(M)=\\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(M,A) to the category of (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-modules is left exact; furthermore, it sends direct sums to direct products, from which it easily follows that E(M)=\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M,E(A)). Finally, the last claim of Proposition 5 is more subtle, and follows from an intrinsic characterisation of the E^i(F) via a local duality theorem which cannot be stated here. Denote by \\omega_Y^q the sheaf \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^n). Then there is a functorial isomorphism for coherent algebraic sheaves {\\mathscr{F}} on Y: \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_Y^q). \\tag{3.8} 1.4 Cohomology class associated to a subvariety In all that follows, X denotes an algebraic set of dimension n, defined over a field k that we assume, for simplicity, to be algebraically closed. Except for in §6, we assume that X is non-singular. We denote by {\\mathscr{O}}_X the structure sheaf of X, and by \\Omega_X^\\bullet=\\bigcup_p\\Omega_X^p the sheaf of germs of differential forms on X. If Y is a closed subset of X, then we identify coherent algebraic sheaves on Y with coherent algebraic sheaves on X that are zero outside of Y; we do this, in particular, with {\\mathscr{O}}_Y and \\Omega_Y. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X whose support is of dimension \\leqslant n-p, and let {\\mathscr{L}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X that is locally free. Then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) is zero for i&lt;p, and there is a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}})). \\tag{4.1} If {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent algebraic sheaf on a closed subset W of X of dimension \\leqslant n-p, then we have a canonical isomorphism \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'\\otimes\\Omega_X^n,\\omega_Y^{n-p}) \\tag{4.1 bis} where \\omega_Y^{n-p} is the sheaf on Y defined in the corollary to Proposition 5 (which can be identified with \\Omega_Y^{n-p} if Y is non-singular). Proof. The formula in (4.1) is an immediate consequence of the spectral sequence from Proposition 1, as well as Proposition 5; by the formula in (3.8), we can write \\begin{gathered} \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = {\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes(\\Omega_X^n)'\\otimes\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\\\= {\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes(\\Omega_X^n)'\\otimes\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_Y^q) \\\\= \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'\\otimes\\Omega_X^n,\\omega_Y^q) \\end{gathered} where q=n-p, whence the formula in (4.1 bis). Setting, in particular, {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_Y and {\\mathscr{L}}=\\Omega_X^p, we obtain (taking into account the fact that \\Omega_X^n\\otimes(\\Omega_X^p)'=\\Omega_X^{n-p}) a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) = \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;\\Omega_X^{n-p},\\omega_Y^{n-p}). \\tag{4.2} Now suppose, for simplicity, that Y is non-singular, so that \\omega_Y^{n-p}=\\Omega_Y^{n-p}. There is a natural homomorphism from \\Omega_X^{n-p} to \\Omega_Y^{n-p}, whence a canonical section s_Y of the sheaf \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p), that we call, if all the components of Y are of dimension n-p, the fundamental section of the sheaf \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p). By (4.1), this section defines an element of \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p). But the natural homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_Y defines a homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^p) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p). We thus obtain an element of \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p), denoted by P_X(Y), that we call the cohomology class of Y in X; it is induced by the section s_Y of \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) by the following diagram of homomorphisms: \\begin{CD} \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^p)) \\\\@VVV \\\\\\begin{gathered} \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^y) \\\\=\\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p) \\end{gathered} \\end{CD} \\tag{4.3} We define a non-singular cycle of dimension n-p to be any element of the free abelian group generated by the non-singular irreducible subvarieties of dimension n-p in X. Then the function Y\\mapsto P(Y) can be extended to a homomorphism from the group of non-singular cycles of dimension n-p on X to the group \\operatorname{H}^p*X,\\Omega_X^p). Let Z^{n-p} and Z'^{n-p'} be non-singular cycles of dimension n-p and n-p' (respectively); we say that they intersect transversally if every component of Z intersects transversally with every component of Z'. Then the cycle Z\\cdot Z' is defined, and is a non-singular cycle of dimension n-p-p'. With this, we have: If Z^{n-p} and Z'^{n-p'} are non-singular cycles that intersect transversally, then P_X(Z\\cdot Z') = P_X(Z)\\cdot P_X(Z') \\tag{4.4} where the product on the right-hand side is the cup product: \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^p)\\times\\operatorname{H}^{p'}(X,\\Omega_X^{p'}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^{p+p'}(X,\\Omega_X^{p+p'}). (We assume that X is isomorphic to a locally closed subset of a projective space). This last hypothesis is used only to be able to conclude that every coherent algebraic sheaf on X is a quotient of a locally-free coherent algebraic sheaf (Serre) and thus admits a left resolution by locally-free sheaves. Proof. To prove Theorem 1, we can assume that Z and Z' are irreducible non-singular subvarieties Y and Y' that intersect transversally. Let {\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet be a left resolution of {\\mathscr{O}}_Y by locally-free sheaves; then, by Proposition 3, the diagram of homomorphisms in (4.3) can be identified with the diagram \\begin{CD} (\\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma)\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big) @&gt;\\beta&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^p\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big)\\big) \\\\@V\\alpha VV . \\\\(\\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma)(\\Omega_X^p) \\end{CD} where \\beta is an isomorphism, and where \\Gamma is the “group of sections” functor on the category of abelian sheaves on X, \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma is its hypercohomology in dimension p, and \\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma is its p-th derived functor. For simplicity, we assume that {\\mathscr{L}}_0={\\mathscr{O}}_X, and that the augmentation {\\mathscr{L}}_0\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_Y is the natural homomorphism (which we can indeed safely assume); then \\alpha is induced by the homomorphism of complexes {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to{\\mathscr{L}} (with {\\mathscr{O}}_X being thought of as a complex concentrated in degree 0), taking into account the fact that \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma({\\mathscr{K}})=\\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma({\\mathscr{K}}_0) if {\\mathscr{K}} is a complex of sheaves concentrated in degree 0. The homomorphism \\beta is a well-known “boundary map”. Consider an analogous diagram, relative to a locally-free resolution {\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet of {\\mathscr{O}}_Y, and consider the commutative diagram of pairings: \\scriptsize \\begin{CD} \\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma(\\Omega_X^p) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^p\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p)\\big)\\big) \\\\@. @. @. \\\\\\times @. \\times @. \\times \\\\@. @. @. \\\\\\operatorname{R}^{p'}\\Gamma(\\Omega_X^{p'}) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^{p'}\\Gamma\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p'})\\big) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^{p'}\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p'})\\big)\\big) \\\\@VVV @VVV @VVV \\\\\\operatorname{R}^{p+p'}\\Gamma(\\Omega_X^{p+p'}) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^{p+p'}\\Gamma\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p+p'})\\big) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\Gamma\\big(\\operatorname{H}^{p+p'}\\big(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p+p'})\\big)\\big) \\end{CD} \\tag{4.5} The pairings in the two columns on the right are induced by the pairing of complexes of sheaves \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^p) \\times \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet,\\Omega_X^{p'}) \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}',\\Omega_X^{p+p'}) that we define by using the exterior product \\Omega_X^p\\times\\Omega_X^{p'}\\to\\Omega_X^{p+p'}; the pairing in the first column is the cup product (relative to the exterior product). I claim that the last line of (4.5) can be identified with the diagram of isomorphisms analogous to (4.3), where Y is replaced by Y\\cap Y' and p by p+p'. For this, it suffices to show that {\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' is a resolution (evidently locally-free) of {\\mathscr{O}}_{Y\\cap Y'}. But then \\operatorname{H}_0({\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}') = {\\mathscr{O}}_Y\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'} = {\\mathscr{O}}_{Y\\cap Y'} and \\operatorname{H}_i({\\mathscr{L}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}') = \\operatorname{Tor}_i^{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,{\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'}) = 0 for i&gt;0, from the fact that Y and Y' intersect transversally. Then Theorem 1 follows from the formula: s_{Y}\\cdot s_{Y'} = s_{Y\\cdot Y'} \\tag{4.6} (where the product on the left-hand side is that from the last column of (4.5)). This formula in (4.6), which is of a purely local nature, can easily be proven by taking {\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet and {\\mathscr{L}}'_\\bullet to be the resolutions described in Proposition 4. We can similarly prove (even more easily) that Z\\mapsto P_X(Z) is compatible with the cartesian product: P_{X\\times X'}(Z\\times Z') = P_X(Z)\\otimes P_{X'}(Z') \\tag{4.7} (a formula which holds true if Z (resp. Z') is a non-singular cycle on the non-singular variety X (resp. X'), with Z\\times Z' being thought of as a non-singular cycle on X\\times X'). From (4.4) and (4.7), it follows that P_X(Z) is also compatible with the operation given by taking the “inverse image” under a morphism f\\colon X\\to X' of non-singular varieties: P_X(f^{-1}(Z')) = f^*(P_{X'}(Z)) \\tag{4.8} a formula which holds true if Z is a non-singular cycle on X' such that f is “transversal” to Z, i.e. such that the graph of f is transversal to the cycle X\\times Z' in X\\times X'. Let X and X' be non-singular varieties that are locally-closed in a projective space, and suppose that X' is complete. Let U be a non-singular cycle on X\\times X', and let a and b be points of X' such that U intersects transversally with the cycles X\\times(a) and X\\times(b). Let Z and Z' be non-singular cycles on X such that Z\\times(a)=(X\\times(a))\\cdot U and Z\\times(b)=(X\\times(b))\\cdot U. Then P_X(Z) = P_X(Z'). Proof. Let f_a\\colon X\\to X\\times X' be defined by f_a(x)=(x,a). Then, by (4.8), we have P(Z)=f_a^*(P(U)); similarly, P(Z')=f_b^*(P(U)). But then, using the Künneth formula \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X\\times X',\\Omega_{X\\times X'}^\\bullet) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X,\\Omega_X^\\bullet)\\otimes\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X',\\Omega_{X'}^\\bullet) and the fact that \\operatorname{H}^0(X',\\Omega_{X'}) is simply the scalars, we easily see that f_a^*=f_b^*, whence the result. For all x\\in X, (x) is a non-singular subvariety of X of codimension n, and thus defines an element \\varepsilon_x of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). If X is a non-singular projective variety, then it follows from the above Corollary 1 that \\varepsilon_x does not depend on the chosen point x, and we thus denote it by \\varepsilon_X and call it the fundamental class of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). To have a satisfying theory, we must define P_X(Z) for arbitrary cycles Z, and prove Theorem 1 for proper intersections of cycles. (At the time of writing this talk, this has still not been done in full generality). Assuming that we have done this, the above Corollary 1 becomes the following: if Z and Z' are two algebraically-equivalent cycles, then P_X(Z)=P_X(Z') (a claim which does not seem to follow from the above, even if Z and Z' are non-singular). [Comp.] As I pointed out in my conference at the international Congress of Mathematicians in 19582, the questions raised here are now completely resolved. The reader will find more information on the duality of coherent sheaves in loco citato, p. 112–115, as well as in EGA III.2, and in SGA (1962). A more systematic treatment can be found in a later chapter of EGA (chapter IX in the provisional plan). 1.5 The duality theorem In this section, X denotes a non-singular projective variety of dimension n. The fundamental class \\varepsilon_X of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) is a basis of this vector space. (The proof of this will be given later on). With the above theorem, we can thus identify \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) with the field k. We now consider the pairings described in §2, which give, in particular, a pairing \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,{\\mathscr{F}})\\times\\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^n) i.e. \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}})\\times\\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). \\tag{5.1} Taking Theorem 2 into account, this pairing defines a homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to (\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}))'. \\tag{5.2} This homomorphism is functorial in {\\mathscr{F}}, and commutes with the coboundary maps relative to the exact sequences 0\\to{\\mathscr{F}}'\\to{\\mathscr{F}}\\to{\\mathscr{F}}''\\to0. The homomorphism in (5.2) is an isomorphism. In particular, we recover the following result of Serre: Let E be an algebraic vector bundle on X, and {\\mathscr{O}}_X(E) the sheaf of germs of regular sections of X. Then we have canonical isomorphisms3 (\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X(E)))' = \\operatorname{H}^{n-p}(X,\\Omega_X^n\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_X(E')). Proof. It suffices to apply Theorem 3 and Corollary 1 of Proposition 1. Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 will follow from the following claim: The homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) \\to (\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}))'\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}} \\tag{5.2 bis} (where {\\mathscr{L}}=\\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n)) induced by the pairing in (5.1) is an isomorphism. We will show that (D) implies Theorem 2. Let k_x={\\mathscr{O}}_{(x)} be the structure sheaf of the variety consisting of a single point x\\in X, and consider the canonical homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to k_x, and the associated homomorphism \\operatorname{H}^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(X,k_x). \\tag{5.3} Its transpose can be identified with the homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;k_x,\\Omega_X^n)\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^n)\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' \\tag{5.4} induced by the homomorphism between the \\operatorname{Ext}^n associated to {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to k_x, i.e. \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;k_x,\\Omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^n) \\tag{5.5} Since (5.3) is an isomorphism, so too is (5.4), and thus so too is (5.5). Since s_{(x)} is a basis of \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^n(X;k_x,\\Omega_X^n) by (4.2), it indeed follows that its image \\varepsilon_X is a basis of \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). It remains only to prove the statement of (D), which will follow in a purely formal way from some elementary facts summarised in the following lemmas. Here we suppose that X is a closed subset (singular or not) of the projective space \\mathbf{P} of dimension r. We use the notation {\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m) to denote the sheaf on \\mathbf{P} denoted by {\\mathscr{O}}(m) in [21], and the notation {\\mathscr{O}}_X(m) for the analogous sheaf on X. The statement of (D) is true if X=\\mathbf{P} and {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m). Proof. This lemma can be proved by a direct calculation. The explicit calculation of the \\operatorname{H}^i(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m)) can be found in [21], but it also can be done in a simpler way. Computing the cup product \\operatorname{H}^i(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m))\\times\\operatorname{H}^j(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m)') \\to \\operatorname{H}^{i+j}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(m+m')) (which is necessary to calculate the pairing in (5.1)) does not present any difficulty. Every coherent algebraic sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X is isomorphic to a sheaf that is some quotient of {\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m)^k, and we can take m to be as large as we wish. Proof. This follows from the fact that {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_X(m) is “generated by its sections” for large enough m; see [21]. Let i&gt;0. Then \\operatorname{H}^{r-i}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(-m))=0 for large enough m; and, for every coherent algebra sheaf {\\mathscr{B}} on X, we have that \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m),{\\mathscr{B}})=0 for large enough m. Proof. The first claim follows from the explicit calculations mentioned above; for the second, we note that we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m),{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^i(X,{\\mathscr{B}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}(m)) (Corollary 1 of Proposition 1), whence the conclusion, by a well-known result of [21]. Combining the previous two lemmas, we find: Let i&gt;0. Then the functor {\\mathscr{F}}\\mapsto\\operatorname{H}^{r-i}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{F}}) on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on \\mathbf{P} is coeffaceable, and so too is the functor \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{B}}) on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on X. Let {\\mathscr{A}} and {\\mathscr{B}} be coherent algebraic sheaves on X, and let {\\mathscr{A}}(m)={\\mathscr{A}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_X(m). Then, for large enough m, the canonical homomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i(X;{\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i({\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}})) = \\operatorname{H}^0(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})(m)) is an isomorphism. Proof. This follows immediately from the spectral sequence in Proposition 1 applied to {\\mathscr{A}}(-m) and {\\mathscr{B}}, since we then have that E_2^{p,q}({\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^q({\\mathscr{A}}(-m),{\\mathscr{B}})) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^q({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})(m)) which is zero for p&gt;0 and large enough m. We now prove (D) in the case where X=\\mathbf{P}. We will first prove that (5.2 bis) is an isomorphism for p=n; since both sides are then left-exact functors (since \\operatorname{H}^{r+i}(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{F}})=0), it follows from Lemma 3 that it suffices to prove the claim for {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}(-m), but this is covered by Lemma 2. Since the homomorphisms in (5.2 bis) are functorial and compatible with the coboundary maps, and since, for p&lt;n, both sides of (5.2 bis) are coeffaceable functors in {\\mathscr{F}} (the corollary to Lemmas 3 and 4), it follows, by a standard argument, that (5.2 bis) is an isomorphism for all p. This proves the duality theorem for the projective space. Now suppose that X is arbitrary, but non-singular. By the duality theorem for \\mathbf{P}, we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{H}^n(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) = \\operatorname{H}^n(\\mathbf{P},{\\mathscr{F}})' = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r). By Lemma 1, the far-right-hand side can be identified with \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^0(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) whence we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{H}^n(X,{\\mathscr{F}})' = \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^0(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n). \\tag{5.6} Taking {\\mathscr{F}}=\\Omega_X^n, we obtain an isomorphism \\eta\\colon \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) \\xrightarrow{\\sim} k. \\tag{5.7} We can prove that the isomorphism in (5.6) is exactly (5.2 bis) with p=n and {\\mathscr{L}}=k, by (5.7). Subsequently, (5.2 bis) is an isomorphism for p=n. To prove that it is an isomorphism for all p, it again suffices to prove that, for p&lt;n, the two sides of (5.2 bis) are coeffaceable functors in {\\mathscr{F}}, and, a fortiori (taking Lemma 3 into account), that the two sides are zero when we take {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m) with large enough m. But, for the left-hand side, this is true by Lemma 4, and for the right-hand side we can write, using the duality theorem for \\mathbf{P}, \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m))' = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-p}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m),\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r). The right-hand side is zero for p&lt;n and large enough m, as follows from Lemma 5 (where in fact X=\\mathbf{P}) and from the fact that {\\mathscr{O}}_X is of cohomological dimension \\leqslant r-n when thought of as a coherent algebraic sheaf on \\mathbf{P} (since X is non-singular), whence \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-p}({\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r) = 0 \\quad\\text{for }p&lt;n. 1.6 The duality theorem for singular varieties Let X be a closed subset of dimension n of the projective space \\mathbf{P} of dimension r. Equation (5.6) can then be written as \\operatorname{H}^n(X,{\\mathscr{F}})' \\simeq \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^0(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) \\tag{6.1} where we set4 \\omega_X^n = E^0({\\mathscr{O}}_X) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n}({\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r). As mentioned in Proposition 5, the sheaf thus defined does not depend on the chosen immersion of X into the non-singular variety \\mathbf{P}. Taking {\\mathscr{F}}=\\omega_X^n in (6.1), we find that \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\omega_X^n)' \\simeq \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;\\omega_X^n,\\omega_X^n) \\tag{6.2} whence the existence of a distinguished element in \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\omega_X^n), corresponding to the identity morphism from \\omega_X^n to itself: \\eta\\colon \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n) \\to k. \\tag{6.3} Then consider the pairings defined by the composition of the \\operatorname{Ext}: \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) \\times \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\omega_X^n) \\tag{6.4} and compose them with the homomorphism \\eta in (6.3); we thus obtain functorial homomorphisms \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-p}(X;{\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_X^n) \\to \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}})' \\tag{6.5} which are compatible with the boundary maps (generalising (5.2)). We can prove that, for p=n, we thus obtain the isomorphism in (6.1). With this, we have: For any given integer k\\geqslant 0, the four following conditions on X are equivalent: The functorial homomorphism in (6.5) is an isomorphism for n-k\\leqslant p\\leqslant n. \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X(-m)) = 0 for n-k\\leqslant p&lt;n and large enough m. The functor \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) on the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on X is coeffaceable for n-k\\leqslant p&lt;n. E^i({\\mathscr{O}}_X) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n+i}({\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\omega_\\mathbf{P}^r) = 0 for 0&lt;i\\leqslant k. Proof. i.\\impliesii. by Lemma 4; ii.\\impliesiii. by Lemma 3; iii.\\impliesi. by a well-known standard argument, taking into account the fact that the two sides of (6.5) are then coeffaceable functors for n-k\\leqslant p&lt; n (the first being so by Lemma 4); finally, ii.\\iffiv. follows from the corollary to the following proposition. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X, and let i be an integer. Then, for large enough m, we have an isomorphism \\operatorname{H}^i(X,{\\mathscr{F}}(-m))' \\simeq \\operatorname{H}^0(X,E^{n-i}({\\mathscr{F}})(m)) \\tag{6.6} where we set E^j({\\mathscr{F}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-n+j}({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r) \\tag{6.7} (compare with Proposition 5 in §3). Proof. Indeed, by the duality theorem for \\mathbf{P}, the left-hand side of (6.6) is isomorphic to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_\\mathbf{P}}^{r-i}(\\mathbf{P};{\\mathscr{F}}(-m),\\Omega_\\mathbf{P}^r), and so (6.6) follows from Lemma 5. For \\operatorname{H}^i(X,{\\mathscr{F}}(-m)) to be zero for large enough m, it is necessary and sufficient for E^{n-i}({\\mathscr{F}}) to be zero. Recall that the E^j({\\mathscr{F}}) do not depend on the projective immersion in question. The condition of the corollary is purely local, and so, if it is satisfied for {\\mathscr{F}}, then it is also satisfied for every sheaf that is locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{F}}^n. In particular, if this condition is satisfied for {\\mathscr{O}}_X, then it is satisfied for every locally-free coherent algebraic sheaf. This is the case, for example, for all i&lt;n if X is non-singular; and for i=0 if no component of X consists of a single point; and for i=0,1 if S is normal and all its components are of dimension &gt;1 (see [21]). For it to be satisfied for i&lt;k, it is necessary and sufficient, by definition, for the local rings {\\mathscr{O}}_x (x\\in X) to be of “homological codimension \\geqslant k” (see [22] for details on this notion). If k=n, then this implies, by Theorem 3 bis, that the duality theorem is true for X, i.e. that (6.5) is an isomorphism for all p and for all {\\mathscr{F}}. We can give many equivalent conditions on the local rings {\\mathscr{O}}_x for this to be the case (Nagata); for example, those that satisfy the Cohen-Macaulay equidimensionality theorem. It is also the case, for example, if X is locally a “complete intersection” in a non-singular ambient variety. 1.7 Poincaré duality Let X be a non-singular projective variety of dimension n. Then \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X)=\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X,\\Omega_X^\\bullet) is a finite-dimensional bigraded anticommutative algebra, that we grade by the total degree, so that \\operatorname{H}^{p,q}(X)=\\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\Omega_X^q) is of degree p+q; the degrees of \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X) are concentrated between 0 and 2n. By Theorem 2 and the corollary to Theorem 3, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X) is a “Poincaré algebra” of dimension 2n, i.e. \\operatorname{H}^{2n}(X) is endowed with an isomorphism to the base field k, and the product \\operatorname{H}^m(X)\\times\\operatorname{H}^{2n-m}(X)\\to\\operatorname{H}^{2n}(X)=k is a duality between \\operatorname{H}^m(X) and \\operatorname{H}^{2n-m}(X). Furthermore, if Y is another non-singular projective variety, then the Künneth formula for coherent algebraic sheaves gives \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X\\times Y) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X)\\otimes\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(Y) \\tag{7.1} which is an isomorphism that is compatible with the Poincaré algebra structures. Furthermore, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X) is, as a commutative algebra, a covariant functor in X, since a morphism f\\colon Y\\to X defines, in an evident way, a homomorphism of graded algebras f^*\\colon \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X)\\to\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(Y). \\tag{7.2} Since we are working with Poincaré algebras, we obtain, by transposition, a homomorphism of vector spaces f_*\\colon \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(Y)\\to\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X). \\tag{7.3} We have seen in §4 that the effect of f^* on cohomology classes that correspond to non-singular cycles can be interpreted geometrically by taking the cohomology classes that correspond to their inverse images. It is important, in our current study, to show that (7.3) corresponds similarly to the “direct image” operation on cycles. This follows (under suitable non-singularity conditions, at least) from the following particular case: If f is the identity map from a non-singular subvariety Y^m of X^n to X^n, then, denoting by 1_Y the unit element of \\operatorname{H}(Y), we have f_*(1_Y) = P_X(Y) \\tag{7.4} where the right-hand side is the cohomology class in X associated to Y. This formula is equivalent to \\langle \\xi^{m,m}, P_X(Y) \\rangle \\varepsilon_Y = f_*(\\xi^{m,m}) \\quad\\text{where }\\xi^{m,m}\\in\\operatorname{H}^m(X,\\Omega_X^m) \\tag{7.4 bis} where \\varepsilon_Y is the fundamental element of \\operatorname{H}^m(Y,\\Omega_Y^m), and this, in the case of non-singular projective varieties, gives a new definition of the cohomology class associated to Y. Proof. To prove Theorem 4, we consider, by Theorem 3, the transpose of the homomorphism \\operatorname{H}^m(X,\\Omega_X^m) \\to \\operatorname{H}^m(Y,\\Omega_Y^m) = \\operatorname{H}^m(X,\\Omega_Y^m) as the homomorphism \\begin{CD} @. \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-m}(X;\\Omega_Y^m,\\Omega_X^n) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;\\Omega_Y^m,\\Omega_Y^m) \\\\@. @VVV @. \\\\\\operatorname{H}^{n-m}(X,\\Omega_X^{n-m}) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-m}(X;\\Omega_X^m,\\Omega_X^n) \\end{CD} \\tag{7.5} We can verify that the element 1_Y of the dual of \\operatorname{H}^m(Y,\\Omega_Y^m) is identified with the element of the right-hand side corresponding to the identity endomorphism of \\Omega_Y^m, and also that the image of this element in \\operatorname{H}^{n-m}(X,\\Omega_X^{n-m}) is indeed P_X(Y). These relations (which could have been given in §4) can be stated, and are indeed true, for arbitrary non-singular varieties, with the second, for example, following from the commutativity of the following diagram of canonical endomorphisms: \\footnotesize \\begin{CD} \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-m}(X;\\Omega_X^m,\\Omega_X^n) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-m}(X;\\Omega_Y^m,\\Omega_X^n) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;\\Omega_Y^m,\\Omega_Y^m) \\\\@VVV @. @VVV \\\\\\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-m}(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_X,\\Omega_X^{n-m}) @&lt;&lt;&lt; \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{n-m}(X;{\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^{n-m}) @&gt;\\sim&gt;&gt; \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(X;\\Omega_X^m,\\Omega_Y^m) \\end{CD} \\tag{7.6} We thus obtain an exact equivalent of the formalism of Poincaré duality for compact oriented varieties. In particular, Theorem 4 allows us to determine the cohomology class associated to the diagonal of X\\times X. By a well-known argument, we thus deduce, for example, a Lefschetz formula: Let f be an endomorphism of a non-singular projective variety X such that the fixed points of f are of multiplicity 1. Then the number of these fixed points is congruent, modulo the characteristic of k, to the alternating sum of the traces of the endomorphisms of the \\operatorname{H}^i(X) defined by f. The restriction on f that we have to make is related to the difficulties mentioned in the remark in §4. We note, however, that the Lefschetz formula still holds true if f is “homotopic” to an endomorphism whose fixed points are all of multiplicity 1. 1.8 Generalisation of the duality theorem Let X be a non-singular algebraic variety such that every coherent algebraic sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X is isomorphic to a locally-free coherent algebraic sheaf (which is the case if X is locally closed in some projective space). Then every coherent algebraic sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X admits a finite resolution {\\mathscr{L}} by locally-free sheaves, and, for any two such resolutions, we can always find a third, along with homomorphisms, from it to the first two, that are compatible with the augmentations. Similarly, if {\\mathscr{L}} is a finite locally-free resolution of {\\mathscr{F}}, and if we have a homomorphism {\\mathscr{F}}'\\to{\\mathscr{F}}, then there exists a finite locally-free resolution {\\mathscr{L}}' of {\\mathscr{F}}' along with a homomorphism {\\mathscr{L}}'\\to{\\mathscr{L}} that is compatible with {\\mathscr{F}}'\\to{\\mathscr{F}}, that we can even assume to be surjective if {\\mathscr{F}}'\\to{\\mathscr{F}} is surjective. This allows us to define, given integers r,s\\geqslant 0, two cohomological multifunctors, with arguments {\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s in the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on X; one takes values in the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on X, and the other in the category of modules over \\operatorname{H}^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X). We define them by the formulas \\begin{aligned} &amp;\\underline{T}_r^{s\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s) \\\\&amp;= \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{A}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{A}}_r), \\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_s))), \\\\&amp;T_r^{s\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s) \\\\&amp;= \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^\\bullet\\Gamma(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{A}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{A}}_r), \\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_s))) \\end{aligned} \\tag{8.1} where \\underline{L}({\\mathscr{F}}) denotes a finite locally-free resolution of the coherent algebraic sheaf {\\mathscr{F}}, and \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^\\bullet\\Gamma({\\mathscr{K}}) denotes the hypercohomology of the space X with respect to the complex of sheaves {\\mathscr{K}}. If r (resp. s) is zero, then we replace the tensor product of the \\underline{L}({\\mathscr{A}}_i) (resp. of the \\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_j)) by {\\mathscr{O}}_X. In particular, \\underline{T}_0^0 and T_0^0 are graded functors with no arguments: \\underline{T}_0^0 is concentrated in degree 0, where it is the sheaf {\\mathscr{O}}_X; and T_0^0 is equal to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X). The fact that the right-hand sides of (8.1) do not depend on the chosen resolutions is evident for \\underline{T} (since the question is then local), and for T it follows from preceding general remarks, taking into account the spectral sequence for the hypercohomology of the complex of sheaves {\\mathscr{K}}=\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{A}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots,\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots that abuts to the hypercohomology of X with respect to {\\mathscr{K}}, and whose initial page is \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\operatorname{H}^q({\\mathscr{K}})), i.e. E_2^{p,q} = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,(\\underline{T}_r^s)^{(q)}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s)). \\tag{8.2} We then see that this spectral sequence itself does not depend on the chosen resolutions, and its abutment is the left-hand side of (8.1). We can easily define the coboundary maps relative to miscellaneous arguments {\\mathscr{A}}_i,{\\mathscr{B}}_j by noting that every exact sequence 0\\to{\\mathscr{F}}'\\to{\\mathscr{F}}\\to{\\mathscr{F}}''\\to0 can be resolved by an exact sequence of finite locally-free complexes. We define, on the system of functors \\underline{T}_r^{s\\bullet} (resp. T_r^{s\\bullet}), operations that are analogous to those of tensor calculus, and whose definitions are immediate from the defining formulas in (8.1). We thus have a composition (generalising that which was described in §2): \\begin{gathered} T_r^{s\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s) \\times T_{r'}^{s'\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}'_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}'_{r'};{\\mathscr{B}}'_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}'_{s'}) \\\\\\to T_{r+r'}^{(s+s')\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r,{\\mathscr{A}}'_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}'_{r'};{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s,{\\mathscr{B}}'_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}'_{s'}) \\end{gathered} \\tag{8.3} that satisfies the evident properties of associativity, compatibility with the functorial homomorphisms and the coboundary homomorphisms, and spectral sequences. Similarly, we have symmetry operations, whose explicit descriptions we leave to the reader. We further have a contraction operation every time one of the arguments {\\mathscr{A}}_i is equal to one of the arguments {\\mathscr{B}}_j: \\begin{gathered} T_r^{s\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_{i-1},{\\mathscr{C}},{\\mathscr{A}}_{i+1},\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_{j-1},{\\mathscr{C}},{\\mathscr{B}}_{j+1},\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s) \\\\\\to -T_{r-1}^{(s-1)\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,\\widehat{{\\mathscr{A}}_i},\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,\\widehat{{\\mathscr{B}}_j},\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s). \\end{gathered} \\tag{8.4} Furthermore, if some argument {\\mathscr{A}}_i is a locally-free sheaf, then we can suppress it by replacing one of the {\\mathscr{A}}_j (for j\\neq i) by {\\mathscr{A}}_j\\otimes{\\mathscr{A}}_i, or one of the {\\mathscr{B}}_k by {\\mathscr{B}}_k\\otimes{\\mathscr{A}}'_i (where {\\mathscr{A}}'_i=\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{A}}_i,{\\mathscr{O}}_X); we have an analogous rule for the case where one of the arguments {\\mathscr{B}}_j is locally free. In particular, we can always suppress any argument that is equal to {\\mathscr{O}}_X. If all the arguments are locally free, except for at most one of the arguments {\\mathscr{B}}_i, then the rule that we have just stated gives a functorial isomorphism T_r^{s\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{B}}_s) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X,{\\mathscr{A}}'_1\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes{\\mathscr{A}}'_{r}\\otimes{\\mathscr{B}}_1\\otimes{\\mathscr{B}}_s) \\tag{8.5} (since we can restrict to the case where r=0 and s=1, and there it is immediate; we can also directly use the spectral sequence whose initial term is (8.2)). The corresponding operations of all the above can also be defined for the \\underline{T}_r^s. The relations between the various operations thus introduced are the same as for the analogous relations in tensor calculus. Now let n be the dimension of X. By successively applying a tensor composition (8.3) and contractions (8.4) on repeated arguments, we obtain a pairing \\begin{gathered} (T_r^s)^p({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots) \\times (T_r^s)^{n-p}({\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots;{\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathscr{A}}_r\\otimes\\Omega_X^n) \\\\\\longrightarrow\\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). \\end{gathered} \\tag{8.6} If X is a non-singular projective variety, then the pairings in (8.6) are dualities. Proof. This follows in a purely formal way from the corollary of Theorem 3. In fact, it easily follows from this corollary that, if {\\mathscr{K}} is a complex of locally-free coherent algebraic sheaves, then the hypercohomology of X with respect to {\\mathscr{K}} is in duality with the hypercohomology of X with respect to {\\mathscr{K}}'\\otimes\\Omega_X^n via the natural pairings \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^p\\Gamma({\\mathscr{K}}) \\times \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^{n-p}\\Gamma({\\mathscr{K}}'\\otimes\\Omega_X^n) \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{R}}^n\\Gamma(\\Omega_X^n) = \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\Omega_X^n). \\tag{8.7} We can see this by using the spectral sequence with initial page \\operatorname{H}^p(\\operatorname{H}^q(X,{\\mathscr{K}})) and the analogous spectral sequence for {\\mathscr{K}}'\\otimes\\Omega_X^n. From the above result, Theorem 6 can be deduced from the definition (8.1). — For the definitions preceding Theorem 6, it was not necessary for X to be non-singular, since it was not necessary to work with only finite resolutions. But, if X is singular, then we can no long be sure, a priori, that the (\\underline{T}_r^s)^p({\\mathscr{A}}_1,\\ldots;{\\mathscr{B}}_1,\\ldots) are coherent sheaves, since, in the complex of sheaves \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{A}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots,\\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_1)\\otimes\\ldots) there will be an infinite number of components of any given total degree. We can easily verify that, in the formulas in (8.1), we can replace one of the \\underline{L}({\\mathscr{B}}_i) with {\\mathscr{B}}_i. Taking Proposition 3 into account, this shows that we have \\begin{aligned} \\underline{T}_1^{1\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}};{\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^\\bullet({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\\\T_1^{1\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}};{\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^\\bullet(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}). \\end{aligned} \\tag{8.8} In particular, taking r=s=1 and {\\mathscr{A}}_1={\\mathscr{O}}_X in (8.6), we recover Theorem 3. Equation (8.8) also implies that T_0^{1\\bullet}({\\mathscr{B}})=\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(X,{\\mathscr{B}}), and that T_1^{0\\bullet}({\\mathscr{A}})=\\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^\\bullet(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{O}}_X). We see, in (8.1), that the functors \\underline{T}_r^{s\\bullet} and T_r^{s\\bullet} have, in general, components in positive and negative degrees. Using the above remark, we see that, if the dimension of X is n, then the non-zero components of \\underline{T}_r^{s\\bullet} are concentrated between degrees -(s-1)n and rn if s&gt;0, and between degrees 0 and rn if s=0; the non-zero components of T_r^{s\\bullet} are concentrated between degrees -(s-1)n and (r+1)n if s&gt;0, and between degrees 0 and (r+1)n if s=0 (and, unless I am mistaken, if r&gt;0, between degrees -(s-1)n and rn, resp. 0 and rn).

For the study of the fundamental group, see SGA V, IX, X, and XI, as well as SGA 1962 (talks X, XII, and XIII) for the Lefschetz-type theorems and numerous open questions. Only the theory of moderately ramified coverings (cf. Theorem 14) has not yet been the subject of a dedicated talk. The corollary to Theorem 14, which completely determines Galois coverings of order coprime to the characteristic of an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field, has been used in an essential manner on three separate occasions: in the proof by Igusa of the Picard inequality for non-singular projective surfaces in arbitrary characteristic; in the study (developed independently by Ogg and Šafarevič) of the group of homogeneous principal bundles over an abelian variety defined over a function field in one variable, in arbitrary characteristic; and in the recent proof, by Artin, of certain key theorems concerning the “Weil cohomology” of algebraic varieties. 2.1 Schemes We know that an affine algebraic space defined over a field k is essentially determined by its affine algebra A (the ring of regular functions defined over k), and the morphisms X\\to Y of algebraic spaces correspond bijectively to homomorphisms A(Y)\\to A(X) of k-algebras. The affine algebra corresponding to an algebraic space is a k-algebra of finite type, and, from the “classical” point of view, it has no nilpotent elements; conversely, every such algebra is obtained as the affine algebra of an algebraic space defined over k. There is thus a known dictionary that allows us to interpret situations concerning affine algebraic spaces in terms of commutative algebra. We have long since noted that we thus obtain more general statements, since it was not generally necessary to suppose that the rings in play were of the form just described, with the Noetherian hypothesis being sufficient the most of the time. In particular, whether or not a base field were given, it was not necessary to exclude the case where these rings contained nilpotent elements. Up until now, geometers had refused to take into account this information, and were obstinate in restricting to the consideration of affine algebra without nilpotent elements, i.e. algebraic spaces in whose structure sheaves there are no nilpotent elements (and even, most of the time, “absolutely irreducible” algebraic spaces). The speaker thinks that this state of mind has been a serious obstacle to the development of truly natural methods in algebraic geometry. Let A be a commutative ring. It is well known that the set X=\\operatorname{Spec}(A) of prime ideals of A is endowed with a natural topology: the “Zariski topology”, or the spectral topology. Also, there is a sheaf of commutative rings {\\mathscr{O}}_X on X, whose fibre at {\\mathfrak{p}}\\in X is the localised ring A_{\\mathfrak{p}}, and whose ring of sections can be identified with A. Thus X becomes a ringed space, and is called the prime spectrum of A. A ring homomorphism f\\colon A\\to B defines a morphism f'\\colon\\operatorname{Spec}(B)\\to\\operatorname{Spec}(A) of ringed spaces, with the underlying map of sets being exactly {\\mathfrak{p}}\\mapsto f^{-1}({\\mathfrak{p}}). The homomorphisms \\operatorname{Spec}(B)\\to\\operatorname{Spec}(A) of ringed spaces obtained in this manner are exactly those for which the homomorphisms {\\mathscr{O}}_x\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_y (where x=f'(y)) are local (i.e. the inverse image of a maximal ideal is a maximal ideal). We define an affine scheme to be a ringed space that is isomorphic to some \\operatorname{Spec}(A), and a prescheme to be a locally-affine ringed space, i.e. such that every point has an open neighbourhood that is an affine scheme for the induced structure. We define, in an evident way, morphisms of preschemes; locally, they correspond to ring homomorphisms. When we fix a prescheme S, and we look at morphisms X\\to S of preschemes, then S plays the role of a base field or base ring (or, even better, of a base space in a fibration). We then say that X is an S-prescheme; if S=\\operatorname{Spec}(A), then this also implies that {\\mathscr{O}}_X is a sheaf of A-algebras. So every prescheme can be regarded in a unique way as a \\mathbb{Z}-prescheme. Of course, S-preschemes form a category, and we can further show that, in this category, the product of two objects X and Y always exists; it is denoted by X\\times_S Y. This notion of product allows us to define the change of base of an S-prescheme, corresponding to a morphism S'\\to S, since X\\times_S S' can be considered as an S'-prescheme. We say that X is separated over S if the diagonal of X\\times_S X is closed. We define a scheme to be a prescheme that is separated over \\mathbb{Z}; it is then separated over anything. For simplicity, we will now only speak of schemes, which we will further suppose to be Noetherian, i.e. finite unions of affine opens that are spectra of Noetherian rings. We say that X is of finite type over S if, for every affine open subset U of S, its inverse image in X is a finite union of affine opens whose rings are algebras of finite type over the ring of U. It is such S-schemes that lend themselves to a properly geometry study. In particular, for every s\\in S, the fibre f^{-1}(s) of X over s is an algebraic scheme over the residue field k(s) of the local ring {\\mathscr{O}}_s of s in S. Thus X can be, to a certain extent, considered as a family of “algebraic spaces” f^{-1}(s), with the parameter s running over S (i.e., from the local point of view, the set of prime ideals of a given ring). Of course, the k(s) can have different characteristics. If S=\\operatorname{Spec}(k), where k is a field, then we essentially recover the usual notion of “algebraic space”, with the only difference being that now the structure sheaf can have nilpotent elements. Inspired by well-known ideas, we can define the notion of a projective morphism, and, more generally, of a proper morphism. Such a morphism is of finite type, and further sends closed subsets to closed subsets, and retains this property under an arbitrary change of base. With X being a (Noetherian, as always) scheme, the sheaf {\\mathscr{O}}_X is a coherent sheaf of rings in the sense of [8]. The coherent sheaves of modules on X are thus also the sheaves which are locally isomorphic to a cokernel of some morphism {\\mathscr{O}}_X^m\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_X^n. 2.2 Formal schemes Let X be a scheme, and X' a closed subset of X. Then there exists a coherent subsheaf {\\mathscr{J}} of {\\mathscr{O}}_X such that X'=\\operatorname{supp}{\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathscr{J}} (and there even exists a largest such one). Endowing X' with the sheaf {\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathscr{J}} makes X' a scheme, denoted X_0; such a scheme is called a closed subscheme of X. We can also, for any n, consider X' endowed with {\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathscr{J}}^{n+1}, denoted X_n, which is a closed subprescheme of X whose underlying set is again X', but with a different structure sheaf, namely {\\mathscr{O}}_{X_n}={\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathscr{J}}^{n+1}. Clearly the {\\mathscr{O}}_{X_n} form a projective system of sheaves of rings on X, whose projective limit \\overline{{\\mathscr{O}}_X} is called the formal completion of {\\mathscr{O}}_X along X'. Endowed with this sheaf of rings, X' is called the formal completion of X along X', and is thus a ringed space, but not a scheme in general. For every coherent sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X, we can similarly consider the formal completion \\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}=\\varprojlim_n{\\mathscr{F}}_n of {\\mathscr{F}} along X' (where {\\mathscr{F}}_n={\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}{\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathscr{J}}^{n+1}), which is a sheaf of modules on \\overline{X}. Its sections are called formal sections of {\\mathscr{F}} along X, and can be identified with elements of \\varprojlim_n\\Gamma(X',{\\mathscr{F}}_n). For {\\mathscr{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_X, we recover the “holomorphic functions” of X along X', in the sense of Zariski (whose terminology we will not follow, due to its interferences with classical terminology). We define a formal scheme (implicitly assumed to be Noetherian) to be a topological space {\\mathfrak{X}} endowed with a sheaf of topological rings {\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}} satisfying the following condition: there is an isomorphism of sheaves of topological rings {\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}}=\\varprojlim_n{\\mathscr{O}}_n, where the {\\mathscr{O}}_n form a projective system of sheaves of rings on {\\mathfrak{X}}, with each one making {\\mathfrak{X}} into a scheme {\\mathfrak{X}}_n, and such that, for m\\geqslant n, the homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_m\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_n is surjective and has {\\mathscr{J}}_m^{n+1} as its kernel, where {\\mathscr{J}}_m is the kernel of {\\mathscr{O}}_m\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_0. We will show that {\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}} is a coherent sheaf of local Noetherian rings. By the definitions, a formal completion \\overline{X} as above is a formal scheme, and, conversely, every formal scheme is locally of this type. In fact, the data of a formal affine scheme (i.e. such that {\\mathfrak{X}}_0 is affine, which implies that all the {\\mathfrak{X}}_n are affine) is equivalent to the data of a separated complete {\\mathscr{J}}-adic Noetherian topological ring. The usual definitions (morphism, morphism of finite type, proper morphism, etc.) for ordinary schemes generalise without problem to formal schemes. 2.3 The three fundamental theorems Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper morphism of schemes (Noetherian, as always), and let Y' be a closed subset of Y', with X' its inverse image in X, and consider the corresponding formal completions \\overline{Y} and \\overline{X}. Then f induces a morphism \\overline{f}\\colon\\overline{X}\\to\\overline{Y} of formal schemes, which is also proper. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent sheaf on X, then \\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}} is a coherent sheaf on \\overline{X}. In Theorem 1, we forget X, Y, and {\\mathscr{F}}, and consider only the proper morphism \\overline{f} of formal schemes, along with the coherent sheaf \\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}} on \\overline{X}. (However, the speaker has only written the complete proof in the case where we start with some X, Y, f, and F). Finiteness theorem. — The \\operatorname{R}^q\\overline{f}_*(\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}) are coherent sheaves on \\overline{Y}. The natural homomorphisms \\operatorname{R}^q\\overline{f}_*(\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}) \\to \\varprojlim_n\\operatorname{R}^q (f_n)_*({\\mathscr{F}}_n) are isomorphisms. In this statement, we suppose that we already have some coherent subsheaf {\\mathscr{J}} of {\\mathscr{O}}_Y that defines Y', whence, by taking the inverse image, a coherent subsheaf of {\\mathscr{O}}_X that defines X', whence, by definition, {\\mathscr{F}}_n, X_n, Y_n, and f_n\\colon X_n\\to Y_n as in §2. The minor changes that need to be made to the notation in the explanation if we started with an arbitrary proper morphism between two formal schemes are evident. Theorem 1 deals only with “formal cohomology”; the following theorem relates it with “algebraic cohomology”, and resembles a well-known theorem of Serre [23] on the comparison between algebraic cohomology and analytic cohomology. First comparison theorem. — The \\operatorname{R}^q f_*({\\mathscr{F}}) are coherent sheaves on Y (which is a particular case of Theorem 1), and the natural homomorphisms \\overline{\\operatorname{R}^q f_*({\\mathscr{F}})} \\to \\varprojlim_n \\operatorname{R}^q (f_n)_*({\\mathscr{F}}_n) are isomorphisms. There are canonical isomorphisms \\overline{\\operatorname{R}^q f_*({\\mathscr{F}})} = \\operatorname{R}^q\\overline{f}_*(\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}). This corollary is, for q=0, a generalisation of Zariski’s “fundamental theorem of holomorphic functions”, from which we will deduce a generalisation of Zariski’s “connection theorem”. We also note that, while Theorem 1 (ii) is trivial for q=, this is not at all the case for Theorem 2 nor for its equivalent formulation (Corollary 1). In fact, the proof proceeds by decreasing induction on q (being trivial for large q, since then both sides of the equation are zero), and the case q=0 thus appears as the last induction step, and so could be called the “most difficult” case. Let Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(A), and let Y' be defined by an ideal {\\mathscr{J}} of A. Then, for every coherent sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X, the H^q(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) are A-modules of finite type, whose {\\mathscr{J}}-adic completions are the H^q(\\overline{X},\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}). Finally, applying this corollary to H=\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{G}}), we obtain: Let Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(A), and let Y' be defined by an ideal {\\mathscr{J}} of A. Let {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{G}} be coherent sheaves on X. Then \\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{G}}) is an A-module of finite type, whose {\\mathscr{J}}-adic completion can be identified with \\operatorname{Hom}(\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}},\\overline{{\\mathscr{G}}}). Of course, the natural map \\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{G}})\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}},\\overline{{\\mathscr{G}}}) is that which sends a homomorphism u\\colon{\\mathscr{F}}\\to{\\mathscr{G}} to its extension “by continuity” \\overline{u}\\colon\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}\\to\\overline{{\\mathscr{G}}} (so that \\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}} becomes a functor in {\\mathscr{F}}). Now suppose that A is separated and complete for its {\\mathscr{J}}-adic topology. Then Corollary 2 and Corollary 3 above give: \\begin{aligned} H^q(X,{\\mathscr{F}}) &amp;= H^q(\\overline{X},\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}), \\\\\\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{G}}) &amp;= \\operatorname{Hom}(\\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}},\\overline{{\\mathscr{G}}}). \\end{aligned} The latter identity shows that the category of coherent sheaves on X can be identified with a subcategory (with morphisms being the induced morphisms) of the category of coherent sheaves on \\overline{X}. In fact, we even have: For a sheaf of modules on \\overline{X} to be coherent, it is necessary and sufficient for it to be isomorphic to a sheaf of the form \\overline{{\\mathscr{F}}}, where {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent sheaf on X (determined up to canonical isomorphism, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 2). [We recall that now Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(A), with A being a complete and separated {\\mathscr{J}}-adic Noetherian topological ring]. The closed subschemes of X are in bijective correspondence with the closed formal subschemes of \\overline{X}. Indeed, they correspond to coherent subsheaves of {\\mathscr{O}}_X (resp. of {\\mathscr{O}}_{\\overline{X}}). Considering the graphs of morphisms as closed subschemes, Corollary 1 implies: Let X and Z be proper schemes over A (which is a separated complete {\\mathscr{J}}-adic Noetherian ring). Then the map g\\mapsto\\overline{g} defines a bijective correspondence between Y-morphism from X to Z and \\overline{Y}-morphisms from \\overline{X} to \\overline{Z}. In other words, proper algebraic schemes over A give a subcategory (with the morphisms being the induced morphisms) of the category of proper formal schemes over \\overline{Y}. We note, however, that there exist proper formal schemes over \\overline{Y} that are not “algebraisable”, i.e. isomorphic to some \\overline{X}, where X is proper over A (just as there exist compact complex-analytic varieties that do not come from algebraic varieties defined over the field of complex numbers). Such formal schemes naturally appear in “module theory”. We note, however, an interesting case where a formal scheme is algebraisable: Let A be a complete local Noetherian ring, with residue field k, and let {\\mathfrak{X}} be a proper formal scheme over A (endowed with its {\\mathfrak{r}}(A)-adic topology). We suppose that the local rings of {\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}} are flat A-modules, or, equivalently, that, if we endow {\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}} and A with the filtration given by powers of the maximal ideal of A, then the associated graded algebras satisfy \\operatorname{gr}({\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}}) \\simeq \\operatorname{gr}^0({\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}})\\otimes_k\\operatorname{gr}(A); H^2({\\mathfrak{X}}_0,{\\mathscr{O}}_{{\\mathfrak{X}}_0})=0, where we consider {\\mathfrak{X}}_0={\\mathfrak{X}}\\otimes_Ak as an algebraic scheme over k; {\\mathfrak{X}}_0 is projective. Then, under these conditions, {\\mathfrak{X}} is algebraisable, and, more precisely, is isomorphic to \\overline{X}, where X is some projective A-scheme. Conditions (ii) and (iii) will be satisfied if, in particular, {\\mathfrak{X}}_0 is a simple curve over k, and Theorem 4 can be applied, in particular, in the “module theory” of curves of a given genus… We will give here a hint on how to prove Theorem 4: we can show (cf. Proposition 3 below) that (i) and (ii) imply that every coherent sheaf on {\\mathfrak{X}}_0 that is locally isomorphic to a fundamental sheaf can be obtained by reduction starting from a sheaf of the same nature on {\\mathfrak{X}}. So, starting with an “ample” sheaf on {\\mathfrak{X}}_0 (which, by (iii), exists), we lift it to obtain an invertible sheaf on {\\mathfrak{X}}, and, using Theorem 1, we prove that a multiple of this invertible sheaf defined an immersion of X into the formal completion of a scheme \\mathbb{P}_A^r (“projective type” of dimension r over A). For the proof of Theorem 1, Theorem 2, and Theorem 3, we refer the reader to [3]. 2.4 Applications to Zariski’s connection theorem and “main theorem” Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper morphism of schemes. Then, by the finiteness theorem (Theorem 1), f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)=\\underline{A} is a coherent sheaf on Y, and is also a sheaf of commutative algebras, and thus corresponds to a Y-scheme g\\colon Y'\\to Y that is finite over Y (defined by the condition of being affine over Y, i.e. the inverse image of an affine open is affine, and g_*({\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'})=\\underline{A}). It is immediate that f then canonically factors as f=gf', where f'\\colon X\\to Y' is a morphism from X to Y that is now such that f'_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'}. This factorisation of f is called the Stein factorisation of f. Applying the first comparison theorem (Theorem 2) and its Corollary 1 to f' and the subset Y' consisting of a single point y', we see that (f')^{-1}(y')=X' is connected (or, in other words, the formal sections of X along X' do not form a local ring, but the completion f'_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)_{y'}={\\mathscr{O}}_{y'} is local!) We have proven: Zariski’s “connection theorem” — Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper morphism. Then f factors uniquely (up to isomorphism) as f=gf', where g\\colon Y'\\to Y is finite, and f'\\colon X\\to Y' is such that f'_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'} (whence g_*({\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'})=f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)). Also, the fibres of f' are connected, i.e. the set of connected components of a fibre f^{-1}(y) of f is in bijective correspondence with the set of points of Y' over y, i.e. the set of maximal ideals in f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)_y. From this, we immediately deduce the usual variants of the connection theorem. We state here only the following: For a point x of X to be isolated in its fibre f^{-1}(y), it is necessary and sufficient for the fibre (f')^{-1}(y') (where y'=f'(x)) to consist of a single point x, or for f' to induce an isomorphism from a neighbourhood of x to a neighbourhood of y'. The set of these points is an open subset U, and f' induces an isomorphism from U to an open subset of Y'. To show that f' is a local isomorphism at x, we note that f' induces an isomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_{y'}\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_x, as we see thanks to f'({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{O}}_{Y'}; we also note that the (f')^{-1}(V) give a fundamental system of neighbourhoods of x when V runs over a fundamental system of neighbourhoods of y' (since f' is a closed map whose fibre at y' consists of the single point x). We thus immediately deduce the following result, due to Chevalley in the “geometric” case: For f to be a finite morphism, it is necessary and sufficient for it to be proper with finite fibres. If this is so, then f' is effectively an isomorphism, by the above. Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism that is not necessarily proper, but suppose that X is contained in some proper Y-scheme \\overline{f}\\colon\\overline{X}\\to Y as an open subset (which is the case if, in particular, \\overline{f} is quasi-projective). Applying Corollary 1, we see that \\overline{f'} induces an isomorphism from the set U of points of X that are isolated in their fibre to an open subset of Y' (and that U is indeed an open subset). We thus deduce the following global version of Zariski’s “main theorem”: Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism of finite type. Then the set U of points of X that are isolated in their fibre is open, and, if f is quasi-projective5, then U is Y-isomorphic to an open subset of some scheme Y' that is finite over Y. Since a morphism of finite type is locally affine, and a fortiori locally quasi-projective, we immediately deduce from Theorem 6 the usual local variants of the main theorem. 2.5 Application to the cohomological study of proper and flat morphisms Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper morphism, and {\\mathscr{F}} a coherent sheaf on X, with {\\mathscr{F}} assumed to be Y-flat, i.e. the {\\mathscr{F}}_x are flat modules over the rings {\\mathscr{O}}_y (where y=f(x)). This also implies that, for every y\\in Y, if we filter {\\mathscr{F}} along the fibre f^{-1}(y) by the {\\mathfrak{m}}_y^n{\\mathscr{F}} (where {\\mathfrak{m}}_y is the maximal ideal of {\\mathscr{O}}_y), then the associated graded algebra is isomorphic to ({\\mathscr{F}}/{\\mathfrak{m}}_y{\\mathscr{F}})\\otimes_{\\mathfrak{K}(y)}\\operatorname{gr}({\\mathscr{O}}_y); in other words, we have that {\\mathfrak{m}}_y^n{\\mathscr{F}}/{\\mathfrak{m}}_y^{n+1} = {\\mathscr{F}}_y\\otimes_{\\mathfrak{K}(y)}({\\mathfrak{m}}_y^n/{\\mathfrak{m}}_y^{n+1}) for every integer n, where {\\mathscr{F}}_y denotes the sheaf {\\mathscr{F}}/{\\mathfrak{m}}_y{\\mathscr{F}} induced by {\\mathscr{F}} on X_y (with X_y denoting the fibre f^{-1}(y) considered as a proper scheme over the residue field \\mathfrak{K}(y) of y). Taking this isomorphism, as well as Theorem 2, into account, we obtain augmentations, and sometimes computations, of the \\operatorname{R}^q f_*({\\mathscr{F}}) in a neighbourhood of y, knowing the cohomology of X_y with coefficients in {\\mathscr{F}}_y. Here Theorem 2 takes the form \\overline{\\operatorname{R}^q f_*({\\mathscr{F}})} = \\varprojlim_n H^q({\\mathscr{F}}_y,{\\mathscr{F}}/{\\mathfrak{m}}_y^n{\\mathscr{F}}). We will mention here only the following consequence: Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper morphism, and {\\mathscr{F}} a coherent Y-flat sheaf on X. Let y\\in Y, let q be an integer, and suppose that H^q(X_y,{\\mathscr{F}}_y)=0. Then \\operatorname{R}^q f_*({\\mathscr{F}}) is zero on a a neighbourhood of y, and, for every n, the natural homomorphism \\operatorname{R}^{q-1}f_*({\\mathscr{F}})_y \\to H^{q-1}(X_y,{\\mathscr{F}}_y/{\\mathfrak{m}}_y^n{\\mathscr{F}}_y) is surjective. In particular, if f is a flat morphism (i.e. if {\\mathscr{O}}_X is Y-flat), then every locally free coherent sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X is Y-flat. Let {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{G}} be two such sheaves, and apply Proposition 1 to \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{G}}) and q=1 to obtain: Let f be a flat proper morphism, {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{G}} locally free coherent sheaves on X, and y\\in Y; suppose that H^1(X_y,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}}_y,{\\mathscr{G}}))=0. Then every homomorphism u_0\\colon{\\mathscr{F}}_y\\to{\\mathscr{G}}_y is induced by a homomorphism u\\colon{\\mathscr{F}}|V\\to{\\mathscr{G}}|V, where V=f^{-1}(U) is the inverse image of a neighbourhood U of y. If u_0 is an isomorphism (resp. a monomorphism, resp. an epimorphism), then so too is u, for small enough U. In particular: Let E_0 be a locally free coherent sheaf on X_y such that H^1(X_y;\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}(E_0,E_0))=0. Then any two locally free sheaves whose restrictions to X_y are isomorphic to E_0 are themselves isomorphic to one another in a neighbourhood of X_y. Thus: Suppose that H^1(X_y,{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_y})=0. Then any two invertible sheaves on X (i.e. locally isomorphic to {\\mathscr{O}}_X) whose restrictions to X_y are isomorphic are themselves isomorphic to one another. It thus follows that: Let Y be a connected scheme, and E a locally free coherent sheaf on Y. Consider the bundle of projective spaces X=\\mathbb{P}(E) associated to E, endowed with its well-known invertible sheaf {\\mathscr{O}}_X(1). Then every invertible sheaf {\\mathscr{L}} on X is isomorphic to a sheaf of the form f^*({\\mathscr{L}}')\\otimes{\\mathscr{O}}_X(n), where {\\mathscr{L}}' is an invertible sheaf on Y, and n is an integer. Further, n is uniquely determined, and {\\mathscr{L}}' is determined up to isomorphism. Corollary 3 above proves that {\\mathscr{L}} is isomorphic to an {\\mathscr{O}}_X(n)-module on a neighbourhood of each fibre. The rest is more or less formal. Proposition 2 allows us to determine the Y-morphisms from X=\\mathbb{P}(E) to another projective bundle. We see, in particular: Let u be an automorphism of X=\\mathbb{P}(E). Then there exists an invertible sheaf {\\mathscr{L}}' on Y, and an isomorphism v from E to E\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' such that u is the isomorphism corresponding to \\mathbb{P}(E)\\xrightarrow{\\sim}\\mathbb{P}(E\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}')=\\mathbb{P}(E); the pair (v,{\\mathscr{L}}') is determined up to isomorphism. Let \\Gamma be the set of classes of invertible bundles {\\mathscr{L}}' on Y such that E\\otimes{\\mathscr{L}}' is isomorphic to E. Its elements are torsion, since, if n is the rank of E, then (by taking n-th exterior powers) we must have that ({\\mathscr{L}}')^{\\otimes n}\\xrightarrow{\\sim}{\\mathscr{O}}_Y. The above corollary can then be expressed by saying that we have an exact sequence of groups: e \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(E)/\\Gamma(Y,{\\mathscr{O}}_Y^*) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_Y(X) \\to \\Gamma \\to e (which can also be deduced from the exact sequence in cohomology induced by the exact sequence of sheaves of groups e \\to {\\mathscr{O}}_X^* \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}\\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}_Y(X) \\to e, where {\\mathscr{O}}_X^* is the sheaf of “units” of {\\mathscr{O}}_X, identified with the centre of \\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}(E).) 2.6 Application to existence and uniqueness theorems for sheaves and schemes over a complete \\mathscr{J}-adic ring Theorem 7 gave a uniqueness result for locally free coherent sheaves, by using Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. Using Theorem 3, we now obtain existence theorems for sheaves, for morphisms of schemes, or for schemes. In the following, A denotes a local Noetherian ring, assumed to be separated and complete. The general method still consists of making formal construction, which consists essentially of doing algebraic geometry over an Artinian ring, and deducing conclusions from this that are “algebraic” in nature, by using the three fundamental theorems. Let {\\mathfrak{X}} be a proper formal scheme that is flat over A, and let {\\mathscr{F}}_0 be a locally free sheaf on X_0 such that H^2(X_0,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}}({\\mathscr{F}}_0,{\\mathscr{F}}_0))=0. Then there exists a locally free sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on {\\mathfrak{X}} that induces, on X_0, a sheaf isomorphic to {\\mathscr{F}}_0. (This {\\mathscr{F}} is also unique up to isomorphism if H^1(X_0,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}}({\\mathscr{F}}_0,{\\mathscr{F}}_0))=0). We construct, step by step, locally free sheaves {\\mathscr{F}}_n on the X_n that induce one another. The construction of {\\mathscr{F}}_0 is met with an obstruction living in H^2(X_0,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}}({\\mathscr{F}}_0,{\\mathscr{F}}_0))\\otimes_{A/{\\mathscr{J}}}({\\mathscr{J}}^n/{\\mathscr{J}}^{n+1}), but this is zero, by hypothesis. Now, using Theorem 3, we obtain: Let X be a proper scheme that is flat over A, and let {\\mathscr{F}}_0 be as above. Then there exists a locally free sheaf {\\mathscr{F}} on X that induces, on X_0, a sheaf that is isomorphic to {\\mathscr{F}}_0. This {\\mathscr{F}} is also unique up to isomorphism if H^1(X_0,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}}({\\mathscr{F}}_0,{\\mathscr{F}}_0))=0. Let X_0 be a scheme of finite type over the field k, and suppose that X_0 is simple (by which we mean absolutely simple) over k, but not necessarily proper over k. Let A be a local Artinian ring with residue field k. We are interested in finding schemes X that are flat over A, and such that X\\otimes_A k=X_0 (this is the starting point of the “theory of modules”, or of “structure variations” of X_0). It is equivalent to give either such an X or, on the topological space X_0, a sheaf {\\mathscr{O}}_X endowed with the following structures: {\\mathscr{O}}_X is a sheaf of A-algebras; {\\mathscr{O}}_X is endowed with an augmentation homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0} (that is compatible with the A-algebra structures); and with the above data being subject to the following conditions: the augmentation induces an isomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}_X\\otimes_A k\\xrightarrow{\\sim}{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}; {\\mathscr{O}}_X is flat over A, i.e. the graded algebra associated to {\\mathscr{O}}_X filtered by the powers of the maximal ideal {\\mathfrak{m}} of A is isomorphic to \\operatorname{gr}^0({\\mathscr{O}}_X)\\otimes_k\\operatorname{gr}(A), i.e. we have isomorphisms {\\mathfrak{m}}^n{\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n+1}{\\mathscr{O}}_X = {\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}\\otimes_k({\\mathfrak{m}}^n/{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n+1}). The fundamental fact is the following: Let X_0 be a simple scheme of finite type over the field k, and assume X_0 to be affine. Let A be a local Artinian ring of residue field k. Then there exists an A-scheme X that is flat over A and such that X\\otimes_A k=X_0. Further, any two such schemes are necessarily isomorphic. Note that the isomorphic in question is not canonical, since X will have, in general, non-trivial A-automorphisms that induce the identity on X_0. Furthermore, there is not, in general, a “canonical” choice of X satisfying the given conditions, except in the case where A is a k-algebra (the case of equal characteristics), where we can take X=X_0\\otimes_k A, i.e. {\\mathscr{O}}_X={\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}\\otimes_k A (whether or not X_0 is affine, in fact). In the case of unequal characteristics, I do not know in general, when X_0 is not affine, if we can “lift” X_0 to an X defined over A. However, for any integer n&gt;0, let A_{n-1}=A/{\\mathfrak{m}}^n, and suppose that we have lifted X_0 to a flat A_{n-1}-scheme X_{n-1}; we intend to lift X_{n-1} to a flat A_n-scheme X_n. We already know, by Theorem 8, that this is possible locally; we can also easily verify that, if U_n lifts an open subset U_{n-1} of X_{n-1}, then the sheaf of groups of automorphisms of U_n (that induce the identity on U_{n-1}) is canonically isomorphic to {\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k}\\otimes_k{\\mathfrak{m}}^n/{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n+1} restricted to U_{n-1}, and thus, in particular, commutative (where {\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k} denotes the sheaf of germs of k-derivations on X_0). It follows easily that we have an obstruction of constructing X_n lifting X_{n-1}, which lives in H^2(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})\\otimes{\\mathfrak{m}}^n/{\\mathfrak{m}}^{n+1}. Then: Let X_0 be a simple scheme of finite type over k, and suppose that H^2(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})=0. Then, for every local Artinian ring A with residue field k, there exists a flat A-scheme X such that X\\otimes_A k=X_0. Also, if we can find one X that is flat over A and that lifts X_0, then, by Theorem 8, the set of classes (up to isomorphism) of flat A-schemes that lift X_0 can be identified with H^1(X_0,\\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}(X)), where \\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}(X) denotes the sheaf of germs of automorphisms of the sheaf {\\mathscr{O_X}} of A-algebras that are compatible with the augmentation. The filtration of {\\mathscr{O}}_X defines a filtration of \\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}(X), with the quotient of this sheaf by the n-th subgroup of the filtration being \\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}(X_n); the graded algebra associated to this filtration is commutative, and can be identified with {\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k}\\otimes_k\\operatorname{gr}(A). In particular, if {\\mathfrak{m}}^{n+1} is the first power of {\\mathfrak{m}} that is not zero, then F^n(\\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}(X)) (the last stage of the filtration) is in the centre of \\underline{\\operatorname{Aut}}(X), and is isomorphic to {\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k}\\otimes_k{\\mathfrak{m}}^n; it is also the sheaf of germs of automorphisms of X that induce the identity on X_{n-1}=X\\otimes_A A/{\\mathfrak{m}}^n. Using these results, we immediately obtain the following statements: Let X_0 be a simple scheme of finite type over k, and let A be a local Artinian ring with residue field k and maximal ideal {\\mathfrak{m}}. Suppose that {\\mathfrak{m}}^{n+1}=0. Let A_{n-1}=A/{\\mathfrak{m}}^n, and let X_{n-1} be a flat A_{n-1}-scheme such that X_{n-1}\\otimes_Ak=X_0. Then the set of classes (up to an isomorphism that induces the identity on X_{n-1}) of flat A-schemes X_n such that X\\otimes_AA_{n-1}=X_{n-1} is either empty, or a homogeneous principal space under H^1(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})\\otimes_k{\\mathfrak{m}}^n. (Note that, in general, there is no privileged choice of origin in the latter homogeneous principal space, since there is no privileged way of lifting X_{n-1} to X_n). Let X_0 be a simple scheme of finite type over k, and suppose that H^1(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})=0. Then, for every local Artinian ring A with residue field k, there exists at most one flat A-scheme X (up to isomorphism) such that X\\otimes_Ak=X_0. Corollary 1 and Corollary 3 immediately imply the claims, which seem more general, obtained by supposing only that A is a complete local Noetherian ring with residue field k, provided that we introduce X as a formal scheme over A: Let k be a field, and X_0 a simple scheme of finite type over k. For every complete locally Noetherian ring A with residue field k, let F(A) be the set of classes (up to an isomorphism that induces the identity on X_0) of formal schemes {\\mathfrak{X}} over A, of finite type, and flat over A, such that X\\otimes_Ak=X_0. With this notation: for all A, if H^1(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})=0 then F(A) has at most one element; if H^2(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})=0 then F(A) has at least one element. Suppose that X_0 is proper over k. Under condition (i) of Theorem 9, for all A, there exists at most (up to an isomorphism that induces the identity on X_0) one scheme X that is proper, flat over A, and such that X\\otimes_Ak=X_0. We can use Corollary 2 of Theorem 3. For example: If X is a proper flat A-scheme such that X\\otimes_Ak is isomorphic to the projective-type scheme {\\mathfrak{P}}_k^r of dimension r over k, then X is isomorphic to {\\mathfrak{P}}_k^r. (We can also deduce this result from Corollary 1 of Proposition 3). Let X_0 be a simple projective scheme over k, and suppose that H^2(X_0,{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0}) = H^2(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k}) = 0. Then, for all A, there exists a flat projective A-scheme such that X\\otimes_Ak=X_0. We can combine Theorem 9 (ii) with Theorem 4. In particular: Let X_0 be the scheme of a complete simple algebraic curve over k. Then, for every complete local Noetherian ring A with residue field k, there exists a “simple curve scheme” X over A, such that X\\otimes_Ak=X_0. — Corollary 3 and Corollary 4 are above all interesting if k is of characteristic p\\neq0, taking A to be a discrete valuation ring of characteristic 0, with residue field k; for example, the “smallest possible A”, i.e. that for which p generates the maximal ideal. (In fact, by theorems of Cohen, it suffices to have Corollary 3 and Corollary 4 for such a ring A). We note that, concerning this point, according to the specialists, we do not know if there exist schemes over a field k that are not reductions \\mod p of a flat scheme defined over such a ring A. At the least, the results of this section give a way of systematically investigating this question. We must start by seeing if the first obstruction that we have, in H^2(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k}), is necessarily zero. We note that Theorem 3, and the corresponding technique, only works for a complete (local, for simplicity) base ring. In order to go from known results concerning the completion of a local ring to the corresponding results for the local ring itself, we would need a fourth “fundamental theorem”, whose precise statement still needs to be found. We will compare the results from this section (mainly the above Corollary 1 and Corollary 2), as well as those from the following, with the results of Kodaira–Spencer on the variation of complex structures. Using the conjectural theorem to which we have just alluded, we should be able to conclude, under the conditions of Corollary 1, but where A is no longer assumed to be complete, that there exists a ring A' that contains A, and that is finite and unramified over A, such that X\\otimes_AA' and X'\\otimes_AA' are A'-isomorphic (where X and X' are given, and are proper flat A-schemes such that X\\otimes_Ak=X'\\otimes_Ak=X_0). This is what we can prove, at least, when X_0={\\mathfrak{P}}_k^r, by using Corollary 1 of Proposition 2. In any case, if H^1(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})=0, then we can prove that the fibres of X and X' over any point y of Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(A) are isomorphic, or at least when we pass to the algebraic closure of the residue field \\mathfrak{K}(y). (We have a local result, seemingly stronger, when we don’t suppose that A is necessarily local). As for “structure variations” of the projective space, we again point out the following question, suggested by a corresponding problem of Kodaira–Spencer. Let X be a proper flat scheme, over a local integral ring A with field of fractions K and residue field k, and suppose that X\\otimes_AK is isomorphic to {\\mathfrak{P}}_K^r. Is it then true that X\\otimes_Ak=X_0 is isomorphic to {\\mathfrak{P}}_k^R (or at least, over the algebraic closure of k)? In this question, we can assume that A is a complete discrete valuation ring. There is an analogous question when X_0 is an abelian variety. [Comp.] (Concerning Remark 1 above). We note that J.-P. Serre has constructed a non-singular projective variety, of dimension 3, over an algebraically closed field k, of characteristic p&gt;0, which does not come from reduction of a proper scheme over a local integral ring with residue field k, and having a field of fractions of characteristic 0.6 Mumford would have found an analogous result, with a non-singular projective surface. [Comp.] (Concerning Remarks 2 and 3 above.) I am now less optimistic concerning the results conjectured here. However, the question concerning structure variations for projective space, mentioned at the end of Remark 3 above, has been positively resolved by Hironaka, and the analogous question for abelian varieties has been resolved by Koizumi. 2.7 Application to the “theory of modules” Since the speaker has only recently encountered this theory himself, we will be obliged to limit ourselves to just cursory remarks. For simplicity, we work over a field k, i.e. we work in equal characteristic, even though Theorem 8 allows us to also discuss the more general case, without any fundamental changes, so it seems. We have not yet gotten past the “formal” stage, but the speaker still hopes to be able to construct true schemes of modules in certain cases from this, and, in particular, construct, for every integer g, a scheme over the integers that plays the role of universal scheme of modules for the simple curves of genus g. [Comp.] We note that Mumford has recently constructed schemes of modules for the curves of genus g (cf. Mumford–Tate seminar, Harvard University, 1961–62). Theorem 10 also proves that the “level n Jacobi schemes” from the theory of modules are non-singular (and even simple over \\underline{\\mathbb{Z}}). We continue to use the setting and notation of Theorem 9, and now suppose that A is a local algebra of finite rank over k, which is assumed to be algebraically closed, for simplicity. Then F(A) can be thought of as a covariant functor in A, with values in the category of sets, with a homomorphism A\\to B of k-algebras defining a map F(A)\\to F(B), since every flat A-scheme X with X\\otimes_Ak=X_0 gives rise to a B-scheme X\\otimes_AB with the same properties. Suppose that we can find a complete local Noetherian k-algebra {\\mathcal{O}}, as well as a functorial isomorphism \\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathcal{O}},A) \\xrightarrow{\\sim} F(A) \\tag{$*$} (where the left-hand side denotes homomorphisms of k-algebras). We can easily see that such an {\\mathcal{O}} is determined up to canonical isomorphism, and so we call the formal spectrum {\\mathfrak{Y}} of {\\mathcal{O}} (i.e. the topological space consisting of a single point, endowed with a sheaf of topological rings consisting of just {\\mathcal{O}}) the formal scheme of modules for X_0. (Note that it does not necessarily exist). Let {\\mathfrak{r}} be the maximal ideal of {\\mathcal{O}}, and, for all n, let {\\mathscr{O}}_n={\\mathcal{O}}/{\\mathfrak{r}}^{n+1} (so that {\\mathscr{O}}_0=k). Then the canonical homomorphism {\\mathcal{O}}\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_n is an element of \\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathcal{O}},{\\mathscr{O}}_n), and thus defines an element of F({\\mathscr{O}}_n), i.e. a flat {\\mathscr{O}}_n-scheme X_n whose restriction \\mod{\\mathfrak{r}} is X_0. These X_n are induced from one another by extension of scalars (i.e. here by reductions), whence it follows that they come from a formal scheme {\\mathfrak{X}} that is well determined by the formal scheme of modules {\\mathfrak{Y}}; further, {\\mathfrak{X}} is flat over {\\mathfrak{Y}}, and {\\mathfrak{X}}_0=X_0. The isomorphism (*) is then given, as we can immediately see, by associating to each homomorphism {\\mathcal{O}}\\to A of k-algebras the class of the A-scheme {\\mathfrak{X}}\\otimes_{{\\mathcal{O}}} A (i.e. to every morphism {\\mathfrak{Y}}'=\\operatorname{Spec}(A)\\to{\\mathfrak{Y}} of k-schemes, we associate the {\\mathfrak{Y}}'-scheme {\\mathfrak{X}}\\otimes_{{\\mathfrak{Y}}}{\\mathfrak{Y}}' given by base change). Furthermore, we see that the isomorphism (*) and its above description still hold even if we only suppose that A is a complete local Noetherian k-algebra (not necessarily Artinian). Of course, as always, {\\mathcal{O}} can indeed a priori have nilpotent elements, and it seems likely that there should exist cases where {\\mathcal{O}} is itself Artinian, without being identical to k. This tells us at which point the point of view of Kodaira–Spencer (restricting to considering the A that are regular rings) is a priori inadequate in the general case. It remains to give sufficient conditions for there to exist a formal scheme of modules for X_0, assumed to be proper over k. Generally, it is easy to give simple necessary and sufficient conditions on a functor A\\to F(A) (from local k-algebras of finite rank to sets) in order for it to be of the form \\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathcal{O}},A) for some suitable {\\mathcal{O}}. We do not give the details here. We point out only that, in the case which we are studying, these conditions impose non-trivial conditions of a cohomological nature on X_0, and it seems unlikely that they will always be satisfied, even though the speaker has not constructed any counterexamples. It seems plausible, however, that the condition H^0(X,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k})=0 is sufficient (even if not at all necessary) in order to guarantee the existence of a formal scheme of modules. We restrict ourselves to stating here a theorem that deals with a particularly simple case (whose analogue in the theory of analytic spaces is well known, cf. Kodaira–Spencer), which can easily be proven using the results from the previous section: Let X_0 be a simple proper scheme over the field k such that H^0(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k}) = H^2(X_0,{\\mathfrak{G}}_{X_0/k}) = 0. Then there exists a formal scheme of modules for X_0, corresponding to a local regular ring {\\mathcal{O}} (i.e. an algebra of formal series over k). As we have already pointed out, it is not true in general that the formal scheme {\\mathfrak{X}} over {\\mathcal{O}} is algebraisable; but we know that this is true, however, when X_0 is projective and H^2(X_0,{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0})=0 (Theorem 4), such as when X_0 is of dimension 1. This is what gives some hope of constructing a scheme of modules over the integers for curves of a given genus… Note also that methods such as those described in this section can be applied in the construction and study of Picard varieties, as well as in many other constructions. We will return to this soon. 2.8 Application to the fundamental group The techniques described allows us to tackle the system study of the fundamental group, using the example of topological theory. The first two theorems stated in this section are generalisations of results in a recent work by Lang–Serre. Let X be a scheme. Then an X-scheme X' is said to be an unramified covering of X if X' is finite over X, i.e. it is defined by a coherent sheaf of algebras {\\mathscr{A}}={\\mathscr{A}}(X') on X; {\\mathscr{A}} is a locally free sheaf on X; for all x\\in X, the quotient {\\mathscr{A}}_x/{\\mathfrak{m}}_x{\\mathscr{A}}_x = {\\mathscr{A}}_x\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}\\pi(x) is a separable algebra over \\mathfrak{K}(x). This notion of unramified covering (due to Serre and the speaker) posses all the elementary properties for which we can reasonably hope, and which we will not list. We restrict ourselves to saying that it gives rise to a Galois theory modelled on classical Galois theory (and containing it; the proofs being overall simpler than the proofs generally seen for the latter) and the Galois theory of topological coverings. More precisely, we define a geometric point of a scheme X to be a morphism a from the spectrum \\xi of an algebraically closed field \\Omega to X, i.e. the data of an algebraically closed extension of the residue field \\mathfrak{K}(x) of a point x=|a| of X (called the locality of the geometric point a). If X' is an unramified covering of X, then we can associate to it the set E_a(X') of “geometric points of X' over a”, i.e. the set of pairs consisting of an x'\\in X' over x and a \\mathfrak{K}(x)-homomorphism to \\Omega. We thus obtain (for fixed (X,a)) a functor F(X,a) from the category R(X) of unramified coverings X' of X to the category of finite sets. If X is connected, then the pair given by R(X) and F(X,a) has all the formal properties necessary in order to be isomorphic to the analogous pair defined by a suitable totally disconnected compact topological group \\pi (i.e. a projective limit of finite groups): we take the category {\\mathcal{C}}(\\pi) of finite sets on which \\pi acts continuously, and the identity functor F(\\pi)(E)=E from this category to the category of finite sets. The group \\pi is also determined up to canonical isomorphic by the condition that ({\\mathcal{C}}(\\pi),F(\\pi)) is isomorphic to a given pair. To be precise, \\pi is called the fundamental group of the connected scheme X at the geometric point a, and we denote it by \\pi_1(X,a). If X is not connected, then we can replace it by the connected component containing x=|a|. If, however, X is connected, then the groups \\pi_1(X,a') and \\pi_1(X,a') are isomorphic for any two geometric points a' and a'' of X (with the isomorphism being determined up to inner automorphism), and thus we can, as per usual, choose the most suitable a for our purposes, such as the generic point of X that is assumed to be irreducible. Of course, \\pi_1(X,a) is a covariant functor in the pointed scheme (X,a). Every statement concerning the classification of inseparable coverings can then be translated into the language of group theory, following the well-known dictionary (except that we must take into account the fact that here we have topological groups). Our goal is to develop an analogue of the homotopy exact sequence of fibre bundles, relative to a proper morphism f\\colon X\\to Y. Clearly, since we don’t know what the higher homotopy groups are, we will only have necessarily incomplete results. In order to be able to apply the fundamental theorems from §3, we must first explain certain elementary lemmas concerning schemes over Artinian rings or fields (following the general procedure!). Let (X',a') be a pointed unramified covering associated to a pointed representation of \\pi_1(X,a) in a finite set E (endowed with a marked point e), Then the canonical morphism \\pi_1(X',a')\\to\\pi_1(X,a) identifies the domain with the stabiliser of e in \\pi_1(X,a) (and is thus injective). Let X be an algebraic scheme over the field k, and let k' be a radicial extension of k. Then every unramified covering of X\\otimes_kk' is given by the inverse image (i.e. extension of scalars) of an unramified covering of X, determined up to isomorphism. It follows, in particular, from these two lemmas that, for every algebraic extension K of k, and every geometric point a' of X'=X\\otimes_kK that projects to the geometric point a of X, that the functorial homomorphism \\pi_1(X',a')\\to\\pi_1(X,a) is injective. Let X be a complete scheme over a local Artinian ring A, such that H^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X)=A. Let X' be an unramified covering of X, and let A'=H^0(X',{\\mathscr{O}}_{X'}), which is thus a ring that is finite over A (and which may a priori be ramified over A). Let X_0 and X'_0 be the reduced subschemes associated to X and X', respectively (obtained by splitting by the sheaves of nilpotent elements in {\\mathscr{O}}_X and {\\mathscr{O}}_{X'}, respectively). Let k be a subfield of A/{\\mathfrak{r}}(A) over which A/{\\mathfrak{r}}(A) is finite (so X_0 is a complete algebraic scheme over k, and X'_0 is an unramified covering). Finally, let \\Omega be an algebraically closed extension of k, and consider the unramified covering X'_0\\otimes_k\\Omega of X_0\\otimes_k\\Omega. Then the following two conditions are equivalent: X'_0\\otimes_k\\Omega is completely decomposed over X_0\\otimes_k\\Omega; the natural morphism X'\\to X\\otimes_AA' is an isomorphism. Under these conditions, A' is an unramified extension of A. Finally, if X' is connected, then condition (i) is equivalent to the following, seemingly weaker, condition: i bis. X'_0\\otimes_k\\Omega admits a regular section over X_0\\otimes_k\\Omega. When condition (ii) is satisfied, we say that the unramified covering X' of X is geometrically trivial. Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper morphism such that f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{O}}_Y. Let a be a geometric point of X, and b its projection over Y. Then \\pi_1(X,a)\\to\\pi_1(Y,b) is surjective. What we need to show is effectively the following: if an unramified covering Y' of Y (corresponding to a locally free sheaf of algebras {\\mathscr{A}}) is such that X\\otimes_YY' is disconnected, then Y' is also disconnected. In fact, {\\mathscr{A}} is then the direct sum of two non-zero sheaves of rings, and thus so too is its direct image, which is exactly {\\mathscr{A}}\\otimes f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{A}}. Let X be a complete scheme over a field k, and suppose that H^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X) is a local ring A, and that A/{\\mathfrak{r}}(A) is radicial over k. Let \\Omega be an algebraic closure of k, and let \\overline{X}=X\\otimes_k\\Omega (which is connected). Pick a geometric point \\overline{a} of \\overline{X} that projects to the geometric point a of X. Then we have an exact sequence e \\to \\pi_1(\\overline{X},\\overline{e}) \\to \\pi_1(X,a) \\to \\pi_1(k,b) \\to e (where \\pi_1(k,b) is the Galois group of \\Omega over k). The fact that the first homomorphism is injective has already been shown with Lemma 1 and Lemma 2; the exactness in the middle follows from Lemma 3; finally, the surjectivity of the last homomorphism (which is the only thing to rely on the fact that A/{\\mathfrak{r}}(A) is radicial) follows from Lemma 4. Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper flat morphism such that, for all y\\in Y, the algebra H^0(f^{-1}(y),{\\mathscr{O}}_{f^{-1}(y)}) is separable over the residue field \\mathfrak{K}(y) (which is the case, for example, if f^{-1}(y) is a separable scheme over \\mathfrak{K}(y), i.e. reduced and such that the fields corresponding to its irreducible components are separable extensions of \\mathfrak{K}(y)). Then the covering Y' of Y associated to f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X) is unramified. The proof is easy, thanks to Theorem 2. This proposition, combined with Lemma 1, practically reduces the homotopical study of proper and flat morphisms (with separable fibres) to the case where f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{O}}_Y (since, using Stein factorisation, we can replace Y by Y'). A flat morphism of finite type whose fibres are separable (resp. simple) schemes is said to be separable (resp. simple). We show that, if f is flat and if f^{-1}(y) is separable (resp. simple) then there exists a neighbourhood of f^{-1}(y) on which f is separable (resp. simple). The same result holds true for “absolutely normal” (this is Bertini’s theorem). Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper morphism such that f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X) = {\\mathscr{O}}_Y \\tag{i} and let X' be a finite scheme over X. Let Y' be the covering of Y corresponding to the Stein factorisation of X'\\to Y (cf. Theorem 5). Let y\\in Y, so that the set of connected components of the fibre F' of X' over y can be identified with the set of points y'\\in Y' over y (Theorem 5). Consider the evident morphism X'\\to X\\times_Y Y' \\tag{$*$} induced by the natural morphisms X'\\to X and X\\to Y'; this will be an isomorphism whenever X' is of the form X\\times_Y Y'', where Y'' is an unramified covering of Y, and then Y' will be exactly Y'', and Equation (*) will be the identity. We wish to precisely give the conditions for which X' is of the form that we have just indicated, i.e. such that Y' is unramified and Equation (*) is an isomorphism. For this, we introduce the fibre F of X at y, which is a proper scheme over \\mathfrak{K}(y), for which F' is a cover (an unramified one if X is). Let F'_1 be a connected component of F' corresponding to a point y'_1 of Y' over y. Suppose further that X' is unramified over X at the points of F'_1 (and thus F'_1 is an unramified cover of F), and F'_1 is a geometrically trivial covering of F (cf. Lemma 3). Under these conditions, there exists an open neighbourhood U' of y'_1 in Y' such that Equation (*) is an isomorphism over U'. Furthermore, Y' is unramified at y'_1 over Y (but can be ramified at other points y' of Y' over y). Of course, conditions (ii) and (iii) are also necessary for the conclusion of the theorem. The proof of the theorem is easy, thanks to Lemma 3 and Theorem 2. Suppose that (i) is still satisfied. For an unramified covering over X to be isomorphic to the inverse image of an unramified covering Y' of Y, it is necessary and sufficient for X' to induce, on each fibre f^{-1}(y), a geometrically trivial covering. By Theorem 11, the set of points of Y for which this condition is satisfied is open, and so it suffices to verify it at the points y which are closed… Note that the following statement is equivalent to Corollary 1: The kernel of the homomorphism \\pi_1(X)\\to\\pi_1(Y) (which is surjective, by Lemma 4) is the closed invariant subgroup generated by the images in \\pi_1(X) of \\pi_1(f^{-1}(y)), where f^{-1}(y) denotes the scheme f^{-1}(y)\\otimes_{k(y)}\\overline{\\mathfrak{K}(y)} (where \\overline{\\mathfrak{K}(y)} denotes an algebraic closure of \\mathfrak{K}(y)). We note that, since we cannot choose the same base point for all the fibres, the homomorphisms \\pi_1(f^{-1}(y))\\to\\pi_1(X) are determined (after having picked a base point for X, and then for Y) only up to composition with an inner automorphism of \\pi_1(X). Under the general conditions of Theorem 11, suppose further that Y, X, and X' are integral, and let K, L, and L' be their fields (respectively). Then there exists a separable sub-extension K' of K in L', linearly disjoint from L, such that L'=LK' (whence L'=L\\otimes_KK'). (We apply the last part of Lemma 3 to the generic fibre of X). The most interesting case in which we can apply Theorem 11 is when f is a separable morphism. Then X' is also separable over Y, and so, by Proposition 4, Y' is unramified over Y, and so the right-hand side X\\times_YY' in Equation (*) is unramified over X. From this, we easily conclude: Suppose, in addition to (i), that f is separable. Let X' be a connected unramified covering of X. For X to be the inverse image of an unramified covering Y' of Y, it is necessary and sufficient for the induced covering \\overline{F}' of a geometric fibre \\overline{F}=\\overline{f^{-1}(y)} to admit a regular section. Note that it was not necessary to suppose that \\overline{F}' be geometrically trivial over \\overline{F} (which will be true a posteriori, even though a priori this condition is a lot stronger). Corollary 3 is equivalent to the following statement: Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper and separable morphism such that f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{O}}_Y. Let \\overline{F} be the geometric fibre of a point y\\in Y, and pick a geometric point in \\overline{F}, which, by the morphisms \\overline{F}\\to X\\to Y, gives geometric points in X and Y; we take these three points as base points for the fundamental groups of \\overline{F}, X, and Y, respectively. Under these conditions, we have the exact sequence \\boxed{\\pi_1(\\overline{F}) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(Y) \\to 0.} From this, we easily deduce the two following statements of Serre–Lang, with all normality hypotheses removed: Let X and Y be connected schemes over a field k, with X or Y proper over k, and suppose that the reduced scheme X_\\mathrm{red} is separable over k (which is automatically true if k is perfect) and complete. Pick a geometric point a (resp. b) in X (resp. Y); this gives a geometric point c=(a,b) in X\\times_kY, and a natural morphism \\pi_1(X\\times_kY,c) \\to \\pi_1(X,a)\\times\\pi_1(Y,b) (induced by the functorial morphisms from \\pi_1(X\\times Y,c) to \\pi_1(X,a) and \\pi_1(Y,b)). This morphism is injective, and further bijective if k is algebraically closed. (The surjectivity in the above claim is almost trivial). We thus deduce, with Serre–Lang: Let X be a connected algebraic scheme over an algebraically closed field k, and let K be an algebraically closed extension of k. Then the fundamental groups of X and X\\times_kK are the same, i.e. every unramified covering of the latter scheme is given by extension of scalars of an unramified covering (which is unique up to isomorphism) of X. — Using Proposition 4, we see that the hypothesis that f_*({\\mathscr{O}}_X)={\\mathscr{O}}_Y in Corollary 4 is not essential. In the general case, instead of putting the trivial group e after \\pi_1(Y), one must continue by \\pi_0(\\overline{F})\\to\\pi_0(X)\\to\\pi_0(Y)\\to e, as in algebraic topology. In general, we cannot say anything at the moment about the kernel of \\pi_1(\\overline{F})\\to\\pi_1(X), although it should involve a \\pi_2(Y). It seems, however, that we should be able to prove that \\pi_1(\\overline{F})\\to\\pi_1(X) is injective if Y is the spectrum of a local ring A, by appealing to Theorem 12 below (which shows that this is the case if A is complete). Theorem 11 used only Theorem 1 and Theorem 2; we will now use Theorem 3, along with the following elementary lemma: Let X be a scheme, and X_0 the corresponding reduced scheme (i.e. where we have killed all the nilpotent elements). Then every unramified covering X'_0 of X_0 is induced by an unramified covering X' of X, determined up to isomorphism. This lemma, which is of a purely local nature, plays a role analogous to that of Theorem 8 here, in the theory of modules. Combining it with the existence theorem (Theorem 3), we obtain: Let A be a complete local Noetherian ring with residue field k. Let X be a proper scheme over A. Then every unramified covering X'_0 of X_0=X\\otimes_Ak is induced by an unramified covering X' of X, unique up to isomorphism. In other words: Pick a geometric point in X_0 as the base point for the fundamental groups of X_0 and X. Then the canonical homomorphism \\pi_1(X_0)\\to\\pi_1(X) is an isomorphism. Applying Lemma 5 to X_0 (supposing that H^0(X_0,{\\mathscr{O}}_{X_0})=k, for simplicity), and noting that, since A is complete, the unramified extensions of A correspond to unramified extensions of its residue field, i.e. \\pi_1(Y)=\\pi_1(k) (where Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(A)). We obtain the exact sequence: e \\to \\pi_1(\\overline{X_0}) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(Y) \\to e. Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper flat morphism, and let y_1 be a point of Y, and y_0 a specialisation of y_1. Consider the corresponding “geometric” fibres \\overline{X_1} and \\overline{X_0}, and suppose that \\overline{X_0} is separable and connected (which implies that \\overline{X_1} satisfies the same conditions). Then we can find a group homomorphism \\pi_1(X_1)\\to\\pi_1(X_0), defined up to inner automorphism. Further, this homomorphism is surjective. We might hope that this homomorphism is always bijective. Unfortunately, this is not the case in general if \\mathfrak{K}(y_0) is of characteristic &gt;0. We will, however, obtain below a group containing the kernel of this homomorphism (at least in the case where \\overline{X_0} is simple), implying that, if \\mathfrak{K}(y_0) is of characteristic 0, then the above homomorphism is bijective (which is a result that we can also prove by transcendentality). At the very least, we already have, in any case, a group containing \\pi_1, given by a special fibre, using the one given by a generic fibre. Using, for example, the fact that an algebraic curve in characteristic p lifts to a curve in characteristic 0 (Corollary 4 of Theorem 9), we obtain, by transcendentality: Let X_0 be the scheme of complete simple curve over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic, and let g be the genus of X_0. Then \\pi_1(X_0) admits 2g topological generators, related by the well-known relation. We thus deduce, by a well-known technique using hyperplane sections: Let X be a simple projective scheme over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. Then \\pi_1(X) admits a finite number of topological generators. We wish to describe the kernel of the homomorphism \\pi_1(\\overline{X_1})\\to\\pi_1(\\overline{X_0}). For this, we can suppose that Y is the spectrum of a discrete complete valuation ring V={\\mathscr{O}}_y (where y=y_0). The question is the equivalent to the following: given an unramified covering \\overline{X'_1} of \\overline{X_1} (which as can suppose to be Galois, if we wish), under which conditions must it come from an unramified covering of X_0? A priori, the given covering comes, by extension of scalars, from an unramified covering X'_1 of X_1\\otimes_KK', where K' is a finite extension of the algebraic closure \\overline{K} of the field of fractions K of V; if X'_1 were Galois, of group G, then we could choose X'_1 to also be Galois of group G. Thus: for X'_1\\otimes_{K'}\\overline{K}=\\overline{X'_1} to come from an unramified covering of X_0, it is necessary and sufficient for there to exists a finite extension K'' of K' in \\overline{K} such that X''_1=X'_1\\otimes_{K'}K'' is of the form X''\\otimes_{V''}K'', where V'' is the normal closure of V in K'', and where X'' is an unramified covering of X\\otimes_V V''. Suppose, for example, that X_0 is absolutely normal, whence X\\otimes_V V'' is normal (since it is flat over V'' and has normal special fibre), and its field of functions is identical to K''(X_1), which is the field of functions of X_1\\otimes_K K'' = (X\\otimes_VK)\\otimes_KK'' = X\\otimes_VK'' = (X\\otimes_VV'')\\otimes_{V''}K''. Let L''=K''(X'_1) be the field of functions of X'_1\\otimes_{K'}K'', which is a separable finite extension of K''(X_1), and the above condition also implies that L'' is an unramified extension of the field of functions of X\\otimes_VV'' (i.e. the normalisation of X\\otimes_V V'' in L'' is unramified over X\\otimes_VV''). It suffices to show that L'' is unramified at the points of the special fibre of X\\otimes_VV'' (since it is unramified over the generic fibre X_1\\otimes_KK''). If X_0 is now simple, then it follows from the “purity theorem” of Nagata–Zariski that it even suffices to show that L'' is unramified over the local ring {\\mathscr{O}}'' of the generic point of the normalisation of X\\otimes_VV'', which is a discrete valuation ring, equal to the normalisation in K''(X_1) of the local ring {\\mathscr{O}}\\subset K(X_1) of the generic point of the special fibre of X. We thus obtain: Under the above conditions, and with the above notation, for the unramified covering X'_1\\otimes_{K'}\\overline{K} of \\overline{X_1}=X_1\\otimes_K\\overline{K} to come from an unramified covering of \\overline{X_0}, it is necessary and sufficient for there to exist a finite sub-extension K'' of \\overline{K}/K' such that K''(X'_1) is unramified over the discrete valuation ring {\\mathscr{O}}''\\subset K''(X_1). Now note that {\\mathscr{O}}'' is the normalisation in K''(X_1) of the discrete valuation ring {\\mathscr{O}}'\\subset K'(X_1) (which is the normalisation of {\\mathscr{O}} in K'(X_1)), and that {\\mathscr{O}}' contains the normalisation V' of V in K', with a uniformiser u of V' being also a uniformiser of {\\mathscr{O}}'. Suppose now that X'_1 is Galois, with Galois group G of order n, coprime to the characteristic p of \\mathfrak{K}(y_0) (which is also the characteristic of the residue field of {\\mathscr{O}}'). Then K'(X_1') is “tamely ramified” over {\\mathscr{O}}', from which it easily follows (via “Abhyankar’s lemma”) that, if we adjoin an n-th root v of a uniformiser of {\\mathscr{O}}', then it becomes unramified over the normalisation of {\\mathscr{O}}' in K'(X_1)(v). But we can take v to be an n-th root of a uniformiser of V', which shows that the condition of Corollary 5 is satisfied. (This idea of using Abhyankar’s lemma and the purity theorem was given to me by Serre). To express the result we thus obtain, we introduce, for every totally disconnected compact group \\pi, the quotient \\overline{\\pi} of \\pi by the closed subgroup generated by its Sylow p-sub-groups, i.e. the projective limit of the discrete quotient groups of \\pi that are of order coprime to p. With this notation, we obtain: Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper flat morphism, y_1 a point of Y, and y_0 a specialisation of y_1. Suppose that \\overline{X_0} is connected and simple. Then the homomorphism \\overline{\\pi_1}(\\overline{X_1})\\to\\overline{\\pi_1}(\\overline{X_0}) induced by the surjective homomorphism from Corollary 2 of Theorem 12 is an isomorphism. In other words: The classification of unramified Galois coverings, of Galois group of order coprime to the characteristic p of \\mathfrak{K}(y_0), is the same for \\overline{X_0} and for \\overline{X_1}. In particular, if \\mathfrak{K}(y_0) is of characteristic 0, then we see, algebraically, that \\pi_1(\\overline{X_1})\\to\\pi_1(\\overline{X_0}) is bijective. We finally point out that the techniques utilised also give the following result, which is more general than Theorem 13: Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a proper simple morphism, and let D be a closed subscheme of X that is simple over Y, and of codimension 1 at all points. Given a fibre Z=f^{-1}(z) of f, let Z'=Z\\setminus Z\\cap D, and let \\pi_1^\\mathrm{t}(\\overline{Z'}) be the quotient of the fundamental group \\pi_1(Z') that classifies the unramified coverings of \\overline{Z'} that are “tamely ramified” over \\overline{Z\\cap D}. Let y_0 and y_1 be as in Theorem 13. Then there exists a surjective homomorphism (defined up to inner automorphism) \\pi_1^\\mathrm{t}(\\overline{X'_1})\\to\\pi_1^\\mathrm{t}(\\overline{X'_0}), and the corresponding homomorphism \\overline{\\pi_1^\\mathrm{t}}(\\overline{X'_1})\\to\\overline{\\pi_1^\\mathrm{t}}(\\overline{X'_0}) is an isomorphism. From this we obtain corresponding variants of the corollaries of Theorem 13, and of Corollary 4 of Theorem 12. Similarly, using Corollary 3 of Theorem 9, we obtain, transcendentally: Let X_0 be the scheme of a complete simple curve over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic, and let S=(s_i)_{1\\leqslant i\\leqslant n} be a finite subset of X_0 with n elements. Then \\pi_1^\\mathrm{t}(X_0\\setminus S) admits 2g+n topological generators, x_i,y_i,\\sigma_j (for 1\\leqslant i\\leqslant g and 1\\leqslant j\\leqslant n), satisfying the relation \\left(\\prod_i x_iy_ix_i^{-1}y_i^{-1}\\right)\\sigma_1\\ldots\\sigma_n = 1, where the \\sigma_j are generators of the inertia groups corresponding to the s_j. For every finite group G of order coprime to the characteristic that is generated by elements \\overline{x_i},\\overline{y_i},\\overline{\\sigma_j} satisfying the above relation, there exists an unramified Galois covering of X_0\\setminus S, of group G, with inertia groups at the points s_j generated by the \\overline{\\sigma_j}. If X_0 is of genus 0, and n=3, then we have a solution to the “three point problem”, at least for Galois coverings of order coprime to the characteristic. (Here, Theorem 9 is actually useless, and it seems that we can deduce the above corollary from the particular case in question in the three point problem). — A more complete study, probably involving generalised Galois coverings of X, X_0, and X_1 (of eventually infinitesimal Galois group), should allow one to recover the kernel in Corollary 2 of Theorem 12. However, a study of coverings admitting ramifications that are not “tame” seems much more difficult. Lemma 6, combined with a result of Grauert concerning the formal completion of a non-singular projective scheme along a hyperplane section (or with the theorem, as yet unproven, mentioned in Remark 2 after Theorem 11), would also allow us to prove, in “abstract” algebraic geometry, the classical Lefschetz theorem on the fundamental group.

[Comp.] For various details concerning the theory of descent, see also SGA VI, VII, and VIII. From a technical point of view, the current exposé, and those that will follow, can be considered as variations on Hilbert’s celebrated “Theorem 90”. The introduction of the method of descent in algebraic geometry seems to be due to A. Weil, under the name of “descent of the base field”. Weil considered only the case of separable finite field extensions. The case of radicial extensions of height 1 was then studied by P. Cartier. Lacking the language of schemes, and, more particularly, lacking nilpotent elements in the rings that were under consideration, the essential identity between these two cases could not have been formulated by Cartier. Currently, it seems that the general technique of descent that will be explained (combined with, when necessary, the fundamental theorems of “formal geometry”, cf. [9]) is at the base of the majority of existence theorems in algebraic geometry.7 It is worth noting as well that this aforementioned technique of descent can certainly be transported to “analytic geometry”, and we can hope that, in the not-too-distant future, the specialists will know how to prove the “analytic” analogues of the existence theorems in formal geometry that will be given in exposé II. In any case, the recent work of Kodaira–Spencer, whose methods seem unfit for defining and studying “varieties of modules” in the neighbourhood of their singular points, show reasonably clearly the necessity of methods that are closer to the theory of schemes (which should naturally complement transcendental techniques). In the present exposé (namely exposé I) we will discuss the most elementary case of descent (the one indicated in the title). The applications of Theorem 1, Theorem 2, and Theorem 3 below (in §B.1) are, however, already vast in number. We will restrict ourselves to giving only some of them as examples, without aiming for the maximum generality possible. We will freely use the language of schemes, for which we refer to the already cited exposé, as well as [6]. We make clear to point out, however, that the preschemes considered in this current exposé are not necessarily Noetherian, and that the morphisms are not necessarily of finite type. So, if A is a local Noetherian ring, with completion \\overline{A}, then we will need to consider the non-Noetherian ring \\overline{\\overline{A}}\\otimes_A\\overline{A}, as well as the morphisms of affine schemes that correspond to the inclusions between the rings in question. A. Preliminaries on categories 3.1 Fibred categories, descent data, {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphisms 3.1.1 (a) A fibred category {\\mathcal{F}} with base {\\mathcal{C}} (or over {\\mathcal{C}}) consists of a category {\\mathcal{C}} for every X\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, a category {\\mathcal{F}}_X for every {\\mathcal{C}}-morphism f\\colon X\\to Y, a functor f^*\\colon{\\mathcal{F}}_Y\\to{\\mathcal{F}}_X, which we also write as f^*(\\xi) = \\xi \\times_Y X for \\xi\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_Y (with X being thought of as an “object of {\\mathcal{C}} over Y”, i.e. as being endowed with the morphism f) for any two composible morphisms X\\xrightarrow{f}Y\\xrightarrow{g}Z, an isomorphism of functors c_{f,g}\\colon (gf)^* \\to f^*g^* with the above data being subject to the conditions that \\operatorname{id}^*=\\operatorname{id} c_{f,g} is the identity isomorphism if f or g is an identity isomorphism for any three composible morphisms X\\xrightarrow{f}Y\\xrightarrow{g}Z\\xrightarrow{h}T, the following diagram, given by using the isomorphisms of the form c_{u,v}, commutes: \\begin{CD} (h(gf))^* @= ((hg)f)^* \\\\@VVV @VVV \\\\(gf)^*h^* @. f^*(hg)^* \\\\@VVV @VVV \\\\(f^*g^*)h^* @= f^*(g^*h^*) \\end{CD} Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category where all fibre products exist. We then define a fibred category {\\mathcal{F}} with base {\\mathcal{C}} by setting {\\mathcal{F}}_X to be the category of objects of {\\mathcal{C}} over X, and the functor f^*\\colon{\\mathcal{F}}_Y\\to{\\mathcal{F}}_X corresponding to a morphism f\\colon X\\to Y being defined by the fibre product Z\\rightsquigarrow Z\\times_Y X. Let {\\mathcal{C}} be the category of preschemes, and, for X\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, let {\\mathcal{F}}_X be the category of quasi-coherent sheaves of modules on X. If f\\colon X\\to Y is a morphism of preschemes, then f^*\\colon{\\mathcal{F}}_Y\\to{\\mathcal{F}}_X is the inverse image of sheaves of modules functor. We thus obtain a category fibred over {\\mathcal{C}}. 3.1.2 (b) A diagram of maps of sets E \\xrightarrow{u} E' \\overset{v_1}{\\underset{v_2}{\\rightrightarrows}} E'' is said to be exact if u is a bijection from E to the subset of E' consisting of the x'\\in E' such that v_1(x')=v_2(x'). Let {\\mathcal{F}} be a fibred category with base {\\mathcal{C}}, and consider a diagram of morphisms in {\\mathcal{C}} S \\xleftarrow{\\alpha} S' \\overset{\\beta_1}{\\underset{\\beta_2}{\\leftleftarrows}} S'' such that \\alpha\\beta_1=\\alpha\\beta_2; this diagram is said to be {\\mathcal{F}}-exact if, for every pair (\\xi,\\eta) of elements of {\\mathcal{F}}_S, the diagram of sets \\operatorname{Hom}(\\xi,\\eta) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha^*} \\operatorname{Hom}(\\alpha^*(\\xi),\\alpha^*(\\eta)) \\overset{\\beta_1^*}{\\underset{\\beta_2^*}{\\rightrightarrows}} \\operatorname{Hom}(\\gamma^*(\\xi),\\gamma^*(\\eta)) \\tag{+} (where \\gamma=\\alpha\\beta_1=\\alpha\\beta_2) is exact. In this above diagram, for simplicity, we have identified \\beta_i^*\\alpha^* with (\\alpha\\beta_i)^*=\\gamma^*, using c_{\\beta_i,\\alpha}. Let {\\mathcal{F}} be a fibred category with base {\\mathcal{C}}, and consider morphisms \\beta_1,\\beta_2\\colon S''\\to S' in {\\mathcal{C}}. Let \\xi'\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_{S'}. We define a gluing data on \\xi' (with respect to the pair (\\beta_1,\\beta_2)) to be an isomorphism from \\beta_1^*(\\xi') to \\beta_2^*(\\xi'). If \\xi',\\eta'\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} are both endowed with gluing data, then a morphism u\\colon\\xi'\\to\\eta' in {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} is said to be compatible with the gluing data if the following diagram commutes: \\begin{CD} \\beta_1^*(\\xi') @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\beta_2^*(\\xi') \\\\@VVV @VVV \\\\\\beta_1^*(\\eta') @&gt;&gt;&gt; \\beta_2^*(\\eta'). \\end{CD} With this definition, the objects of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} that are endowed with gluing data (with respect to \\beta_1 and \\beta_2) then form a category. If \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is a morphism such that \\alpha\\beta_1=\\alpha\\beta_2, then, for every \\xi\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_{S'}, the object \\xi'=\\alpha^*(\\xi) of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} is endowed with a canonical gluing data, since \\beta_i^*\\alpha^*(\\xi) \\simeq (\\alpha\\beta_i)^*(\\xi) = \\gamma^*(\\xi), where we again set \\gamma=\\alpha\\beta_1=\\alpha\\beta_2; furthermore, if u\\colon\\xi\\to\\eta is a morphism in {\\mathcal{F}}_s, then \\alpha^*(u)\\colon \\alpha^*(\\xi) \\to \\alpha^*(\\eta) is a morphism in {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} that is compatible with the canonical gluing data. We thus obtain a canonical functor from the category {\\mathcal{F}}_S to the category of objects of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} endowed with gluing data with respect to the pair (\\beta_1,\\beta_2). With this, we can also rephrase Definition 1.3 by saying that the diagram (+) is {\\mathcal{F}}-exact if the above functor is fully faithful, i.e. if the above functor defines an equivalence between the category {\\mathcal{F}}_S and a subcategory of the category of objects of {\\mathcal{F}}_S endowed with gluing data with respect to (\\beta_1,\\beta_2). We say that a gluing data on \\xi'\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} is effective (with respect to \\alpha) if \\xi', endowed with this data, is isomorphic to \\alpha^*(\\xi) for some \\xi\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_S. In the case where the diagram (+) is {\\mathcal{F}}-exact, the object \\xi in Definition 1.5 is then determined up to unique isomorphism, and the category {\\mathcal{F}}_S is equivalent to the category of objects of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} endowed with effective gluing data. 3.1.3 (c) The most important case is that where S'' = S' \\times_S S', with the \\beta_i being the two projections p_1 and p_2 from S'\\times_S S' to its two factors (where we now suppose that {\\mathcal{C}} has all fibre products). We then have two immediate necessary conditions for a gluing data \\varphi\\colon p_1^*(\\xi')\\to p_2^*(\\xi') on some \\xi'\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_S to be effective: \\Delta^*(\\varphi) = \\operatorname{id}_\\xi, where \\Delta\\colon S'\\to S'\\times_S S' denotes the diagonal morphism, and where we identify \\Delta^* p_i^*(\\xi') with (p_i\\Delta)^*(\\xi')=\\xi'. p_{31}^*(\\varphi) = p_{32}^*(\\varphi)p_{21}^*(\\varphi), where p_{ij} denotes the canonical projection from S'\\times_S S'\\times_S S' to the partial product of its ith and jth factors. We define descent data on \\xi'\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_{S'}, with respect to the morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S, to be a gluing data on \\xi' with respect to the pair (p_1,p_2) of canonical projections S'\\times_S S'\\to S' that satisfies conditions (i) and (ii) above. A morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is said to be an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism if the diagram of morphisms S \\xleftarrow{\\alpha} S' \\overset{p_1}{\\underset{p_2}{\\leftleftarrows}} S'\\times_S S' is {\\mathcal{F}}-exact (Definition 1.3); we say that \\alpha is a strict {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism if, further, every descent data (Definition 1.6) on any object of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} is effective. This latter condition (of strictness) can also be stated in a more evocative way: “giving an object of {\\mathcal{F}}_S is equivalent to giving an object of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} endowed with a descent data”. Note that, if an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism8 \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S admits a section s\\colon S\\to S' (i.e. a morphism s such that \\alpha s=\\operatorname{id}_S), then it is a strict {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism: if \\xi'\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} is endowed with descent data with respect to \\alpha, then “it comes from” \\xi=s^*(\\xi'). 3.1.4 (d) We can present the above notions in a more intuitive manner, by introducing, for an object T of {\\mathcal{C}} over S, the set \\operatorname{Hom}_S(T,S') = S'(T), where elements will be denoted by t, t', etc. Given an object \\xi'\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_{S'}, there then corresponds, to every t\\in S'(T), an object t^*(\\xi') of {\\mathcal{F}}_T, which will also be denoted by \\xi'_t. A gluing data on \\xi' (with respect to (p_1,p_2)) is then defined by the data, for every T over S, and every pair of points t,t'\\in S'(T), of an isomorphism \\varphi_{t',t}\\colon \\xi'_t \\to \\xi'_{t'} (satisfying the evident conditions of functoriality in T). Conditions (i) and (ii) of §A.1.c can then be written as i bis. \\varphi_{t,t}=\\operatorname{id}_{\\xi'_t}, for all T and all t\\in S'(T). ii bis. \\varphi_{t,t''}=\\varphi_{t,t'}\\varphi_{t',t''}, for all T and all t,t',t''\\in S'(T). We can show that (ii bis) implies that \\varphi_{t,t}^2=\\varphi_{t,t}, by taking t=t'=t'', and thus, since \\varphi_{t,t} is an isomorphism by hypothesis, implies (i bis), which is thus a consequence of (ii bis) (and so (i) is also a consequence of (ii)). But if we no longer suppose a priori that the \\varphi_{t,t} are isomorphisms (i.e. that \\varphi\\colon p_1^*(\\xi')\\to p_2^*(\\xi') is an isomorphism), then (ii bis) no longer necessarily implies (i bis); the combination of (ii bis) and (i bis), however, does imply that the \\varphi_{t,t'} are isomorphisms (since we then have \\varphi_{t,t'}\\varphi_{t',t}=\\varphi_{t,t}=\\operatorname{id}_{\\xi'_t}). 3.2 Exact diagrams and strict epimorphisms, descent morphisms, and examples 3.2.1 (a) Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category. A diagram of morphisms T \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} T' \\overset{\\beta_1}{\\underset{\\beta_2}{\\rightrightarrows}} T'' is said to be exact if, for all Z\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, the corresponding diagram of sets \\operatorname{Hom}(Z,T) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(Z,T') \\rightrightarrows \\operatorname{Hom}(Z,T'') is exact (Definition 1.2). We then say that (T,\\alpha) (or, by an abuse of language, T) is a kernel of the pair (\\beta_1,\\beta_2) of morphisms. This kernel is evidently determined up to unique isomorphism. If {\\mathcal{C}} is the category of sets, then the above definition is compatible with Definition 1.2. Dually, we define the exactness of a diagram of morphisms in {\\mathcal{C}} S \\xleftarrow{\\alpha} S' \\overset{\\beta_1}{\\underset{\\beta_2}{\\leftleftarrows}} S'' and then say that (S,\\alpha) is a cokernel of the pair (\\beta_1,\\beta_2) morphisms. A morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is said to be a strict epimorphism if it is an epimorphism and, for every morphism u\\colon S'\\to Z, the following necessary condition is also sufficient for u to factor as S'\\to S\\to Z: for every S''\\in{\\mathcal{C}} and every pair \\beta_1,\\beta_2\\colon S''\\to S of morphisms such that \\alpha\\beta_1=\\alpha\\beta_2, we also have that u\\beta_1=u\\beta_2. If the fibre product S'\\times_S S' exists, then it is equivalent to say that the diagram S \\xleftarrow{\\alpha} S' \\overset{p_1}{\\underset{p_2}{\\leftleftarrows}} S'\\times_S S' is exact, i.e. that S is a cokernel of the pair (p_1,p_2). In any case, a cokernel morphism is a strict epimorphism. Note also that, if a strict epimorphism is also a monomorphism, then it is an isomorphism. We leave to the reader the task of developing the dual notion of a strict monomorphism. To make the relation between the ideas of {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphisms and strict epimorphisms more precise, we introduce the following definitions: A morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is said to be a universal epimorphism (resp. a strict universal epimorphism) if, for every T over S, the fibre product T'=S'\\times_S T exists, and the projection T'\\to T is an epimorphism (resp. a strict epimorphism). In very nice categories (such as the category of sets, the category of sets over a topological space, abelian categories, etc.), the four notions of “epijectivity” introduced above all coincide; they are, however, all distinct in a category such as the category of preschemes, or the category of preschemes over a given non-empty prescheme S, even if we restrict to S-schemes that are finite over S. A morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is said to be a descent morphism (resp. a strict descent morphism) if it is an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism (resp. a strict {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism) (cf. Definition 1.7), where {\\mathcal{F}} denotes the fibred category over {\\mathcal{C}} of objects of {\\mathcal{C}} over objects of {\\mathcal{C}} (cf. Example 1). If {\\mathcal{C}} has all finite products and (finite) fibre products, then there is an identity between descent morphisms in {\\mathcal{C}} and strict universal epimorphisms in {\\mathcal{C}}. 3.2.2 (b) Let {\\mathcal{C}} be the category of preschemes. Let S\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, and let S' and S'' be preschemes that are finite over S, i.e. that correspond to sheaves of algebras {\\mathscr{A}}' and {\\mathscr{A}}'' over S that are quasi-coherent (as sheaves of modules) and of finite type (i.e. coherent if S is locally Noetherian). Let \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S be the structure morphism of S', and let \\beta_1 and \\beta_2 be S-morphisms from S'' to S', defined by algebra homomorphisms {\\mathscr{A}}'\\to{\\mathscr{A}}'', which we also denote by \\beta_1 and \\beta_2. Using the fact that a finite morphism is closed (the first Cohen–Seidenberg theorem), we can easily prove that the diagram in {\\mathcal{C}} S \\xleftarrow{\\alpha} S' \\overset{\\beta_1}{\\underset{\\beta_2}{\\leftleftarrows}} S'' \\tag{+} is exact if and only if the diagram of sheaves on S {\\mathscr{O}}_S = {\\mathscr{A}} \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} {\\mathscr{A}}' \\overset{\\beta_1}{\\underset{\\beta_2}{\\rightrightarrows}} {\\mathscr{A}}'' is exact. In particular, if \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is a finite morphism corresponding to a sheaf {\\mathscr{A}}' of algebras on S, then \\alpha is a strict epimorphism if and only if the diagram of sheaves {\\mathscr{O}}_S = {\\mathscr{A}} \\to {\\mathscr{A}}' \\overset{p_1}{\\underset{p_2}{\\rightrightarrows}} {\\mathscr{A}}'\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{A}}}{\\mathscr{A}}' is exact (it is an epimorphism if and only if {\\mathscr{A}}\\to{\\mathscr{A}}' is injective). If S is affine of ring A, then S' is affine of ring A', with A' finite over A, and so S'\\to S is a strict epimorphism if and only if A\\to A' is an isomorphism from A to the subring of A' consisting of the x'\\in A' such that 1_{A'}\\otimes_A x' - x'\\otimes_A 1_{A'} = 0 (it is an epimorphism if and only if A\\to A' is injective). As we have already mentioned, even if S is the scheme of a local Artinian ring, then a finite morphism S'\\to S that is an epimorphism is not necessarily a strict epimorphism. However, we can prove that, if S is a Noetherian prescheme, then every finite morphism S'\\to S that is an epimorphism is the composition of a finite sequence of strict epimorphisms (also finite). This also shows that the composition of two strict epimorphisms is not necessarily a strict epimorphism. 3.2.3 (c) If (+) is an exact diagram of finite morphisms, then, for every flat morphism T\\to S of prescheme, the diagram induced from (+) by a change of base T\\to S is again exact. It thus follows that, if X and Y are S-preschemes, with X flat over S, then the following diagram of maps (where X' and Y' are the inverse images of X and Y over S', and X'' and Y'' are their inverse images over S'') is exact: \\operatorname{Hom}_S(X,Y) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{S'}(X',Y') \\rightrightarrows \\operatorname{Hom}_{S''}(X'',Y''). In particular, if {\\mathcal{F}} denotes the fibred category (over the category {\\mathcal{C}} of preschemes) such that, for X\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, {\\mathcal{F}}_X is the category of flat X-preschemes, then the diagram (+) is {\\mathcal{F}}-exact. (This result becomes false if we do not impose the flatness hypothesis; in particular, a finite strict epimorphism is not necessarily a descent morphism). We similarly see that (+) is {\\mathcal{F}}-exact if {\\mathcal{F}} denotes the fibred category for which {\\mathcal{F}}_X is the category of flat quasi-coherent sheaves on the prescheme X (here, again, the flatness hypothesis is essential). In either case, the question of effectiveness of a gluing data (and, more specifically, of a descent data, when S''=S'\\times_S S') on a flat object over S' is delicate (and its answer in many particular cases in one of the principal objects of these current exposés). The speaker does not know if, for every finite strict epimorphism S'\\to S, every descent data on a flat quasi-coherent sheaf on S' is effective (even if we suppose that S is the spectrum of a local Artinian ring, and we restrict to locally free sheaves of rank 1). More generally, let A be a ring, and A' an A-algebra (where everything is commutative) such that the diagram A \\to A' \\rightrightarrows A'\\otimes_A A' is exact, which is equivalent to saying that the corresponding morphism S'\\to S between the spectra of A' and A is an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism, where {\\mathcal{F}} is the fibred category of flat quasi-coherent sheaves. Let M' be a flat A'-module endowed with a descent data to A, i.e. with an isomorphism \\varphi\\colon M'\\otimes_A A' \\xrightarrow{\\sim} A'\\otimes_A M' of (A'\\otimes_A A')-modules that satisfies conditions (i) and (ii) of §A.1.c (which we leave to the reader to write out in terms of modules). Is this data effective (relative to the fibred category of flat quasi-coherent sheaves)? Let M be the subset of M' consisting of the x'\\in M' such that \\varphi(x'\\otimes_A 1_{A'}) = 1_{A'}\\otimes_A x', which is a sub-A-module of M'. The canonical injection M\\to M' defines a homomorphism of A'-modules M\\otimes_A A'\\to M'. The effectiveness of \\varphi then implies the following: M is a flat A-module, and the above homomorphism is an isomorphism. In the above, we have imposed no flatness hypotheses on the morphisms of the diagram (+), and this obliges us, in order to have a technique of descent, to impose flatness hypotheses on the objects over S and S' that we consider. In §B.2, we will impose a flatness hypothesis on \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S, which will allow us to have a technique of descent for objects over S and S' that are no longer under any flatness hypotheses. In any case, there is a flatness hypothesis involved somewhere. This is one of the main reasons for the importance of the notion of flatness in algebraic geometry (whose role could not be visible when we restricted to base fields, over which everything, in fact, is flat!). 3.3 Application to étalements Let A be a local ring, and B a local algebra over A whose maximal ideal induces that of A. We say that B is étalé over A (instead of “unramified”, as used elsewhere) if it satisfies the following conditions: B is flat over A; and B/{\\mathfrak{m}}B is a separable finite extension of A/{\\mathfrak{m}}=k (where {\\mathfrak{m}} denotes the maximal ideal of A). If A and B are Noetherian, and k is algebraically closed, then this implies that the homomorphism \\overline{A}\\to\\overline{B} between the completions that extends A\\to B is an isomorphism. A morphism f\\colon T\\to S of finite type is said to be étale at x\\in T, or T is said to be étalé over S at x, if {\\mathscr{O}}_x is étalé over {\\mathscr{O}}_{f(x)}; f is said to be étale, or an étalement, or T is said to be étalé over S, if f is étale at all x\\in T. Note that, if S is locally Noetherian, then the set of points of T where f is étale is open, and Zariski’s “main theorem” allows us to precisely state the structure of T/S in a neighbourhood around such a point (by an equation of well-known type). If S is a scheme of finite type over the field of complex numbers, then there exists a corresponding analytic space \\overline{S} (in the sense of Serre [24]), except for the fact that \\overline{S} can have nilpotent elements in its structure sheaf, which changes nothing essential in [24]. We then easily see that f is an étalement if and only if \\overline{f}\\colon\\overline{T}\\to\\overline{S} is an étalement, i.e. if every point of \\overline{T} admits a neighbourhood on which \\overline{f} induces an isomorphism onto an open subset of \\overline{S}. In particular, to every étale covering T of S (i.e. every finite étale morphism f\\colon T\\to S), there is a corresponding étale covering \\overline{T} of \\overline{S}, which is connected if and only if T is connected [24]. We can also easily see that, if T and T' are étale schemes over S, then the natural map \\operatorname{Hom}_S(T,T') \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\overline{S}}(\\overline{T},\\overline{T}'') is bijective, i.e. the functor T\\mapsto\\overline{T} from the category of étale schemes over S to the category of analytic spaces over S is “fully faithful”, and thus defines an equivalence between the first category and a subcategory of the second. A theorem of Grauert–Remmert [6] implies that, if S is normal, then we thus obtain an equivalence between the category of étale coverings of S and the category of (finite) étale coverings of S, i.e. every étale covering {\\mathscr{C}} of \\overline{S} is \\overline{S}-isomorphic to some \\overline{T}, where T is an étale covering of S. We will show that the Grauert–Remmert theorem remains true without any normality hypotheses on S. First let S'\\to S be a finite strict epimorphism, and suppose that the theorem has been proven for S'; we will show that it holds for S. Let {\\mathscr{C}} be an étale covering of \\overline{S}, and consider its inverse image {\\mathscr{C}}' over S', which corresponds to a coherent analytic sheaf {\\mathfrak{A}}' of algebras on S' that is the inverse image of a sheaf of algebras {\\mathfrak{A}} on \\overline{S} defining {\\mathscr{C}}. By hypothesis, on S', {\\mathscr{C}}' comes from an étale covering T' of S', i.e. {\\mathfrak{A}}' comes from a coherent sheaf of algebras {\\mathscr{A}}' on S'. Also, {\\mathfrak{A}}' is endowed with a canonical descent data with respect to \\overline{S}'\\to\\overline{S}, i.e. with an isomorphism between its two inverse images on \\overline{S}'\\times_{\\overline{S}}\\overline{S}'=\\overline{S'\\times_SS'} (satisfying conditions (i) and (ii)), and this isomorphism comes from, by what has already been said, an isomorphism between the corresponding algebraic sheaves, i.e. from a descent data on {\\mathscr{A}}' with respect to S'\\to S. We can easily show that the latter is effective (since it is effective on {\\mathfrak{A}}', and the effectiveness of a descent data, as described explicitly in the previous section, is something that can be checked locally on the completions of the modules that are involved). From this, we obtain a coherent sheaf of algebras {\\mathscr{A}} on S that defines a covering T of S, and this is the desired covering. The above result then obviously holds true if S'\\to S is just a composition of a finite number of finite strict epimorphisms, i.e. is just an arbitrary finite epimorphism (by the factorisation result stated in §A.2. It thus follows that the Grauert–Remmert theorem holds true if S is a reduced scheme, i.e. such that {\\mathscr{O}}_S has no nilpotent elements, as we can see by introducing its normalisation S'. We can easily pass to the general case. A completely analogous argument, again using the factorisation result for finite strict epimorphisms, and the “formal” nature of the effectiveness of descent data, allows us to prove the following result: let S be a locally Noetherian prescheme, and let S'\\to S be a finite, surjective, and radicial morphism (or, equivalently, a morphism of finite type such that, for every T over S, the morphism T'=S'\\times_S T\\to T is a homeomorphism, which we can also express by saying that S'\\to S is a universal homeomorphism). For every T étalé over S, consider its inverse image T'=T\\times_S S', which is étalé over S'. Then the functor T\\mapsto T' is an equivalence between the category of preschemes T that are étalé over S and the category of preschemes T' that are étalé over S'. (We use the bijectivity of \\operatorname{Hom}_S(T_1,T_2) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{S'}(T'_1,T'_2) for preschemes T_1 and T_2 that are étalé over S, which can be proven directly without difficulty. We also use the fact that the stated theorem is true if S'=(S,{\\mathscr{O}}_S/{\\mathscr{J}}), where {\\mathscr{J}} is a nilpotent coherent sheaf of ideals of {\\mathscr{O}}_S, cf. [20]). Note also that we do not suppose here that the T in question are finite over S. This result implies, in particular, that the morphism S'\\to S induces an isomorphism between the fundamental group of S' and the fundamental group of S (“topological invariance of the fundamental group of a prescheme”). 3.4 Relations to 1-cohomology 3.4.1 (a) Let {\\mathcal{C}} be a category such that the product of any two objects always exists, and let T\\in{\\mathcal{C}}. For every finite set I\\neq\\varnothing, we can consider T^I, and so we obtain a covariant functor from the category of non-empty finite sets to the category {\\mathcal{C}}, i.e. what we can call a simplicial object of {\\mathcal{C}}, denoted by K_T. This object depends covariantly on T; also, if u and v are morphisms T\\to T', then the corresponding morphisms K_T\\to K_{T} are homotopic. We say that T dominates T' if \\operatorname{Hom}(T,T')\\neq\\varnothing, and this gives an (upward) directed preorder on {\\mathcal{C}}. It follows from the above that, if T dominates T', then there exists a canonical class (up to homotopy) of homomorphisms of simplicial objects K_T\\to K_{T'}; in particular, if K_T and K_{T'} are such that T and T' dominate one another, then K_T and K_{T'} are homotopically equivalent. Now let F be a (contravariant, to be clear) functor from {\\mathcal{C}} to an abelian category {\\mathcal{C}}'. Then C^\\bullet(T,F) = F(K_T) is a cosimplicial object of {\\mathcal{C}}', and thus defines, in a well-known way, a (cochain) complex in {\\mathcal{C}}', of which we can take the cohomology: \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(T,F) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(C^\\bullet(T,F)) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(F(K_T)) (we may write a subscript “{\\mathcal{C}}” on the \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet if there is any possibility for confusion). This is a cohomological functor in F, of which the variance for T varying follows from what has already been said about the K_T; more precisely, for fixed F and varying T in {\\mathcal{C}} (preordered by the domination relation), the \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(T,F) form an inductive system of graded objects of {\\mathcal{C}}'; in particular, if T and T' are such that each one dominates the other, then \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(T,F) and \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(T',F) are canonically isomorphic. Suppose that {\\mathcal{C}} has all fibre products. Then we can, for fixed S\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, apply the above to the category {\\mathcal{C}}_S of objects of {\\mathcal{C}} over S; we then write C^\\bullet(T/S,F) and \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(T/S,F) instead of C^\\bullet(T,F) and \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(T,F) if we wish to make clear that we are working in the category {\\mathcal{C}}_S; then C^\\bullet(T/S,F) is a cochain complex in {\\mathcal{C}}' that, in degree n, is equal to F(T\\times_S T\\times_S\\ldots\\times_S T) (where there are n+1 factors T). Note that, as per usual, we can define \\operatorname{H}^0(T/S,F) without assuming the category {\\mathcal{C}}' to be abelian: it is the kernel (Definition 2.1), if it exists, of the pair (F(p_1),F(p_2)) of morphisms F(T) \\to F(T\\times_S T) corresponding to the two projections p_1,p_2\\colon T\\times_S T\\to T. In particular, we then have the natural morphism (called the augmentation) F(S) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(T/S,F) which is an isomorphism in nice cases (in particular, in the case where T\\to S is a strict epimorphism and F is “left exact”). Similarly, if F takes values in the category of groups in a category {\\mathcal{C}}'', then we can also define \\operatorname{H}^1(T/S,F); in the case where {\\mathcal{C}}'' is the category of sets (i.e. when F takes values in the category of non-necessarily-commutative groups), \\operatorname{H}^1(T,F) is the quotient of the subgroup Z^1(T/S,F) of C^1(T/S,F) = F(T\\times_S T) consisting of the g such that F(p_{31})(g) = F(p_{32})(g) F(p_{21})(g) by the group with operators F(T) acting on C^1(T/S,F), and thus, in particular, on the subset Z^1(T/S,F), by \\rho(g')\\cdot g = F(p_2)(g') g F(p_1)(g')^{-1}. 3.4.2 (b) For example, let {\\mathcal{F}} be a fibred category with base {\\mathcal{C}}. Let \\xi,\\eta\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_S, and, for all S' over S, let F_{\\xi,\\eta}(S') = \\operatorname{Hom}(\\xi\\times_S S', \\eta\\times_S S'). Then F_{\\xi,\\eta} is a contravariant functor from {\\mathcal{C}}_S to the category of sets. With this setup, saying that the augmentation morphism F_{\\xi,\\eta}(S) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(S'/S,F_{\\xi,\\eta}) is an isomorphism for every pair of elements \\xi,\\eta\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_S implies that \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism (Definition 1.7). 3.4.3 (c) Similarly, for \\xi\\in{\\mathcal{F}}_S and any object S' of {\\mathcal{C}} over G_\\xi(S') = \\operatorname{Aut}(\\xi\\times_S S'), we thus define a contravariant functor G_\\xi from {\\mathcal{C}}_S to the category of groups. With this setup, we claim that Z^1(S'/S,G) is canonically identified with the set of descent data on \\xi'=\\xi\\times_S S' with respect to S'\\to S (Definition 1.6), and that \\operatorname{H}^1(S'/S,G) can be identified with the set of isomorphism classes of objects of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'} endowed with a descent data relative to \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S that are isomorphic, as objects of {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'}, to \\xi'=\\xi\\times_S S'. Then, if \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism (cf. §A.4.b), then \\operatorname{H}^1(S'/S,G) contains as a subset the set of isomorphism classes of objects \\eta of {\\mathcal{F}}_S such that \\eta\\times_S S' is isomorphic (in {\\mathcal{F}}_{S'}) to \\xi\\times_S S'; further, this inclusion is the identity if and only if every descent data on \\xi'=\\xi\\times_S S' with respect to \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is effective. (This will be the case, in particular, if \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is a strict S-descent morphism). The cochain complexes of the form C^\\bullet(T/S,F) contain, as particular cases, the majority of standard known complexes (that of Čech cohomology, of group cohomology, etc.), and play an important role in algebraic geometry (notably in the “Weil cohomology” of preschemes). 3.4.4 (d) Let S' be an object over S\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, and let \\Gamma be a group of automorphisms of S' such that S' is “formally \\Gamma-principal over S”, i.e. such that the natural morphism \\Gamma\\times S' \\to S'\\times_S S' (where \\Gamma\\times S' denotes the direct sum of \\Gamma copies of S') is an isomorphism. (We suppose that all the necessary direct sums exist in {\\mathcal{C}}). Let F be a contravariant functor from {\\mathcal{C}} to the category of abelian groups. Then C^\\bullet(S'/S,F) is canonically isomorphic to the simplicial group C^\\bullet(\\Gamma,F(S')) of standard homogeneous cochains, and so \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(S'/S,F) is canonically isomorphic to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\Gamma,F(S'). 3.4.5 (e) Let {\\mathcal{C}} be the category of preschemes. We denote by \\operatorname{G_a} (for “additive group”) the contravariant functor from {\\mathcal{C}} to the category of abelian groups, defined by \\operatorname{G_a}(X) = \\operatorname{H}^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X). We similarly define the functor \\operatorname{G_m} (for “multiplicative group”) by \\operatorname{G_m}(X) = \\operatorname{H}^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X)^\\times (i.e. the group of invertible elements of the ring \\operatorname{H}^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X)), and, more generally, the functor \\operatorname{GL}(n) (for “linear group of order n”) by \\operatorname{GL}(n)(X) = \\operatorname{GL}(n,\\operatorname{H}^0(X,{\\mathscr{O}}_X)), which is a functor from {\\mathcal{C}} to the category of (not-necessary-commutative, if n&gt;1) groups; for n=1 we recover \\operatorname{G_m}. We can also think of \\operatorname{GL}(n) as an automorphism functor (cf. §A.4.c) by considering the fibred category {\\mathcal{F}} with base {\\mathcal{C}} such that {\\mathcal{F}}_X is the category of locally free sheaves on X, for X\\in{\\mathcal{C}}, since then \\operatorname{GL}(n)(X)=\\operatorname{Aut}_{{\\mathcal{F}}_X}({\\mathscr{O}}_X^n). By §A.4.b, it follows that, if \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism (cf. §A.2.c), then \\operatorname{H}^1(S'/S,\\operatorname{GL}(n)) contains the set of isomorphism classes of locally free sheaves on S whose inverse image on S' is isomorphic to {\\mathscr{O}}_{S'}^n, and this inclusion is an equality if and only if every descent data on {\\mathscr{O}}_{S'}^n (with respect to \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S) is effective. If S is the spectrum of a local ring, then this implies that \\operatorname{H}^1(S'/S,\\operatorname{GL}(n))=(e), since every locally free sheaf on S is then trivial. We note that the following conditions concerning a morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S are equivalent: The augmentation homomorphism \\operatorname{H}^0(S,{\\mathscr{O}}_S) = \\operatorname{G_a}(S)\\to\\operatorname{H}^0(S'/S,\\operatorname{G_a}) is an isomorphism. \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphism (where {\\mathcal{F}} is the fibred category over {\\mathcal{C}} described above). \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is a strict epimorphism (cf. §A.2.c). Now suppose that S=\\operatorname{Spec}(A) and S'=\\operatorname{Spec}(A'); then C^n(S'/S,\\operatorname{G_a}) = C^n(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_a}) = \\underbrace{A'\\otimes_A A'\\otimes_A\\ldots\\otimes_A A'}_{n+1\\text{ copies of }A'} with the coboundary operator C^n(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_a})\\to C^{n+1}(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_a}) being the alternating sum of the face operators \\partial_i(x_0\\otimes x_1\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes x_n) = x_0\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes x_{i-1}\\otimes1_{A'}\\otimes x_i\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes x_n. Similarly, C^n(S'/S,\\operatorname{G_m})=C^n(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_m}) can be identified with (\\bigotimes_A^{n+1}A')^\\times, with the simplicial operations for C^\\bullet(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_m}) being induced by those in C^\\bullet(S'/S,\\operatorname{G_a}). We can write down the simplicial operations for C^\\bullet(A'/A,\\operatorname{GL}(n)) in the same explicit manner. In all the cases known to the speaker, \\operatorname{H}^i(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_a})=0 for i&gt;0, and, if A is local, then \\operatorname{H}^1(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_m})=0, and, more generally, \\operatorname{H}^1(A'/A,\\operatorname{GL}(n))=(e) (if S'\\to S is an {\\mathcal{F}}-descent morphisms, i.e. if the diagram A\\to A'\\rightrightarrows A'\\otimes_A A' is exact, then compare this with §A.2.c). We note that Hilbert’s “Theorem 90” is exactly the fact that \\operatorname{H}^1(S'/S,\\operatorname{G_m})=0 if A is a field and A' is a finite Galois extension of A (cf. Example 1), and we can also express it by saying that, in the case in question, S'\\to S is a strict descent morphisms for the fibred category of locally free sheaves of rank 1. This latter statement is the one that is most suitable to generalise Hilbert’s theorem, by varying the hypotheses both on the morphism S'\\to S and on the quasi-coherent sheaves in question. Finally, we note that, for a local Artinian A with maximal ideal {\\mathfrak{m}}, and an A-algebra A' (where we denote, for any integer k&gt;0, the ring A/{\\mathfrak{m}}^{k+1} (resp. A'/{\\mathfrak{m}}^{k+1}A') by A_k (resp. A'_k)), the following properties are equivalent: \\operatorname{H}^1(A'_k/A_k,\\operatorname{G_a})=0 for all k. \\operatorname{H}^1(A'_k/A_k,\\operatorname{G_m})=0 for all k. \\operatorname{H}^1(A'_k/A_k,\\operatorname{GL}(n))=(e) for all k and all n. If S'\\to S is a strict epimorphism, then the above conditions imply that it is a strict descent morphism for free modules (not necessarily of finite type) over A'. The definition of the groups \\operatorname{H}^i(S'/S,\\operatorname{G_m}) in the case where S (resp. S') is a scheme over the field A (resp. A') is due to Amitsur. The group \\operatorname{H}^2(S'/S,\\operatorname{G_m}) is particularly interesting as a “global” variant of the Brauer group, for which we can refer to [4]. B. Descent by faithfully flat morphisms 3.5 Statement of the descent theorems A morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S of prescheme is said to be flat if {\\mathscr{O}}_{x'} is a flat module over the ring {\\mathscr{O}}_{\\alpha(x')} for all x'\\in S' (i.e. if {\\mathscr{O}}_{x'}\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{O}}_{\\alpha(x')}}M is an exact functor in the {\\mathscr{O}}_{\\alpha(x')}-module M). A morphism is said to be faithfully flat if it is flat and surjective. For example, if S=\\operatorname{Spec}(A) and S'=\\operatorname{Spec}(A'), then S' is flat over S if and only if A' is a flat A-module, and S' is faithfully flat over S if and only if A' is a faithfully flat A-module (i.e. if and only if A'\\otimes_A M is an exact and faithful functor in the A-module M); this also implies, in the terminology of Serre [24], that the pair (A,A') is flat. If S' is faithfully flat over S, then the inverse image functor of quasi-coherent sheaves on S is exact and faithful; in other words, for a sequence of homomorphisms of quasi-coherent sheaves on S to be exact, it is necessary and sufficient that its inverse image on S' be exact (in particular, for a homomorphism of quasi-coherent sheaves on S to be a monomorphism (resp. an epimorphism, resp. an isomorphism), it is necessary and sufficient that its inverse image on S' be a monomorphism (resp. an epimorphism, resp. an isomorphism)). This property holds true if we restrict to an arbitrary open subset of S', and then characterise faithfully flat morphisms in this form. A morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is said to be quasi-compact if the inverse image of every quasi-compact open subset U of S is quasi-compact (i.e. a finite union of affine open subsets). It evidently suffices to verify this property for the affine open subsets of S. For example, an affine morphism (i.e. a morphism such that the inverse image of an affine open subset is affine) is quasi-compact. The class of flat (resp. faithfully flat, resp. quasi-compact) morphisms is stable under composition and by “base extension”, and of course contains all isomorphisms. Let \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S be a morphism of preschemes that is faithfully flat and quasi-compact. Then \\alpha is a strict descent morphism (cf. Definition 1.7 for the fibred category {\\mathcal{F}} of quasi-coherent sheaves (cf. §A, Example 2). This statement implies two things: If {\\mathcal{F}} and {\\mathscr{G}} are quasi-coherent sheaves on S, and {\\mathcal{F}}' and {\\mathscr{G}}' their inverse images on S', then the natural homomorphism \\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathcal{F}},{\\mathscr{G}}) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}({\\mathcal{F}}',{\\mathscr{G}}') is a bijection from the left-hand side to the subgroup of the right-hand side consisting of homomorphisms {\\mathcal{F}}'\\to{\\mathscr{G}}' that are compatible with the canonical descent data on these sheaves, i.e. whose inverse images under the two projections of S''=S'\\times_S S' to S' give the same homomorphism {\\mathcal{F}}''\\to{\\mathscr{G}}''. Every quasi-coherent sheaf {\\mathcal{F}}' on S' endowed with a descent data with respect to the morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S (cf. Definition 1.6 is isomorphic (endowed with this data) to the inverse image of a quasi-coherent sheaf {\\mathcal{F}} on S. Setting {\\mathcal{F}}={\\mathscr{O}}_S in (i), we obtain: Let {\\mathscr{G}} be a quasi-coherent sheaf on S, with {\\mathscr{G}}' and {\\mathscr{G}}'' denoting its inverse images on S' and S''=S'\\times_S S' (respectively), and let p_1 and p_2 be the two projections from S'' to S. Then the diagram of maps of sets \\Gamma({\\mathscr{G}}) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha^*} \\Gamma({\\mathscr{G}}') \\overset{p_1^*}{\\underset{p_2^*}{\\rightrightarrows}} \\Gamma({\\mathscr{G}}'') is exact (cf. Definition 1.1. Also, the combination of (i) and (ii) with Definition 1.1 gives: Let {\\mathscr{G}} be as in Corollary 1. Then there is a bijective correspondence between quasi-coherent subsheaves of {\\mathscr{G}} and quasi-coherent subsheaves of {\\mathscr{G}}' whose inverse images on S'' under the two projections p_1 and p_2 give the same subsheaf of {\\mathscr{G}}. Of course, we have an equivalent statement in terms of quotient sheaves. As we have already seen in §A.4.e, Theorem 1 should be thought of as a generalisation of Hilbert’s “Theorem 90”, and implies, as particular cases, various formulations in terms of 1-cohomology. For the proof, we can easily reduce to the case where S=\\operatorname{Spec}(A) and S'=\\operatorname{Spec}(A'), and, for (i), we can easily restrict to proving Corollary 1, i.e. the exactness of the diagram M = A\\otimes_A M \\to A'\\otimes_A M \\rightrightarrows A'\\otimes_A A'\\otimes_A M for every A-module M, which follows from the more general lemma: Let A' be a faithfully flat A-algebra. Then, for every A-module M, the M-augmented complex C^\\bullet(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_a})\\otimes_A M (cf. §A.4.e) is a resolution of M. Proof. It suffices to prove that the augmented complex induced from the above by extension of the base A to A' satisfies the same conclusions. This leads to proving the statement when we replace A by A', and A' by A'\\otimes_A A', and so we can restrict to the case where there exists an A-algebra homomorphism A'\\to A (or, in geometric terms, the case where S' over S admits a section). In this case, the claim follows from the generalities of §A.4.a. We note, in passing, the following corollary, which generalises a well-known statement in Galois cohomology (compare with §A.4.e): If A' is faithfully flat over A, then \\operatorname{H}^0(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_a})=A, and \\operatorname{H}^i(A'/A,\\operatorname{G_a})=0 for i\\geqslant 1. Proof. Part (ii). To prove part (ii) of Theorem 1, we proceed, as for (i), by restricting to the case where S' over S admits a section, where the result then follows from (i) (cf. §A.1.c). We can evidently vary Theorem 1 and its corollaries ad libitum by introducing various additional structures on the quasi-coherent sheaves (or systems of sheaves) in question. For example, the data on S of a quasi-coherent sheaf of commutative algebras “is equivalent to” the data on S' of such a sheaf endowed with a descent data relative to \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S. Taking into account the functorial correspondence between such quasi-coherent sheaves on S and affine preschemes over S, we obtain the second claim of the following theorem: Let \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S be as in Theorem 1. Then \\alpha is a (non-strict, in general) descent morphism (cf. §A, Definition 2.4), and it is a strict descent morphism for the fibred category of affine schemes over preschemes (cf. §A, Definition 1.7. The first claim of the theorem implies this: let X and Y be preschemes over S, with X' and Y' their inverse images over S, and X'' and Y'' their inverse images over S''=S'\\times_S S'; then the diagram of natural maps \\operatorname{Hom}_S(X,Y) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha^*} \\operatorname{Hom}_{S'}(X',Y') \\overset{p_1^*}{\\underset{p_2^*}{\\rightrightarrows}} \\operatorname{Hom}_{S''}(X'',Y'') is exact, i.e. \\alpha^* is a bijection from \\operatorname{Hom}_S(X,Y) to the subset of \\operatorname{Hom}_{S'}(X',Y') consisting of homomorphisms that are compatible with the canonical descent data on X' and Y' (i.e. whose inverse images under the two projections from S'' to S' are equal). This follows easily from Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, if we restrict to Y being affine over S; in the general case, we need to combine Theorem 1 with the following result: Let \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S be a faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism. Then S can be identified with a topological quotient space of S', i.e. every subset U of S such that \\alpha^{-1}(U) is open, is open. To complete Theorem 2, we must give effectiveness criteria for a descent data on an S'-prescheme X' (in the case where X' is not assumed to be affine over S'). Note first of all that such a descent data is not necessarily effective, even if S is the spectrum of a field k, S' the spectrum of a quadratic extension k' of k, and S'' a proper algebraic scheme of dimension 2 over S' (as we can see, due to Serre, by using the non-projective surface of Nagata). For a descent data on X'/S' with respect to \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S (assumed to be faithfully flat and quasi-compact) to be effective, it is necessary and sufficient that X' be a union of open subsets X'_i that are affine over S' and “stable” under the descent data on X'. This is certainly the case (for any X'/S' and any descent data on X') if the morphism \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is radicial (i.e. injective, and with radicial residual extensions). We can also show that this is the case if \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is finite, and every finite subset of X' that is contained in a fibre of X' over S is also contained in an open subset of X' that is affine over S (this is the Weil criterion). It is, in particular, the case if X'/S' is quasi-projective, and, in this case, we can show that the “descended” prescheme X/S is also quasi-projective (and projective if X'/S' is projective). In summary: Let \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S be faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism of preschemes. If \\alpha is radicial, then it is a strict descent morphism. If \\alpha is finite, then it is a strict descent morphism with respect to the fibred category of quasi-projective (or projective) preschemes over preschemes. I do not know if, in the second claim above, the hypothesis that \\alpha be finite is indeed necessary; we can prove that, in any case, we can “formally” replace it by the following, seemingly weaker, hypothesis: for every point of S there exists an open neighbourhood U, a finite and faithfully flat U' over U, and an S-morphism from U' to S'. A type of case that is not covered by the above is that where S=\\operatorname{Spec}(A) and S'=\\operatorname{Spec}(\\overline{A}), with A a local Noetherian ring and \\overline{A} its completion; or even that where S' is quasi-finite over S (i.e. locally isomorphic to an open subset of a finite S-scheme) but not finite. In these two cases, the speaker also does not know the answer to the following question: let X be an S-scheme such that X'=X\\times_S S' is projective over S'; is it then true that X is projective over S? [Comp.] A morphism S'\\to S that is quasi-finite, étale, surjective, or a morphism of the form \\operatorname{Spec}(\\overline{A})\\to\\operatorname{Spec}(A), is not always a strict descent morphism, even if A is the local ring of an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field k and S=\\operatorname{Spec}(A). We can thus find a proper simple morphism f\\colon X\\to S that makes X into a principal E-bundle over S, with E an elliptic curve, such that f'\\colon X'\\to S' is projective, but f is not projective. So this is also an example of a homogeneous principal bundle that is non-isotrivial under an abelian scheme. 3.6 Application to the descent of certain properties of morphisms Let P be a class of morphisms of preschemes. Let \\alpha\\colon S\\to S' be a morphism of preschemes, and let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism of S-preschemes, with f'\\colon X'\\to Y' the inverse image of f under \\alpha. We can then ask if the relation “f'\\in P” implies that “f\\in P”. It appears that the answer is affirmative in many important cases, if we suppose that \\alpha is faithfully flat and quasi-compact (this latter hypothesis being sometimes overly strong). We can see this directly without difficulty if P is the class of surjective (resp. radicial) morphisms (with these two cases following from the surjectivity of \\alpha), or flat (resp. faithfully flat, resp. simple) morphisms (with these three cases following from the faithful flatness of \\alpha), or morphisms of finite type. Using Theorem 1, Theorem 2, and Lemma 1.2, we see that it is also true if P is one of the following classes: isomorphisms, open immersions, closed immersions, immersions (if f is of finite type, and Y is locally Noetherian), affine morphisms, finite morphisms, quasi-finite morphisms, open morphisms, closed morphisms, homeomorphisms, separated morphisms, or proper morphisms. The only important case not covered here is that of projective or quasi-projective morphisms, which has already been discussed in the remark in §B.1. 3.7 Decent by finite faithfully flat morphisms Let \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S be a finite morphism, corresponding to a sheaf of algebras {\\mathscr{A}}' on S that is locally free and of finite type as a sheaf of modules, and everywhere non-zero. Then \\alpha is a faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism, to which we can thus apply the above results. The data of a quasi-coherent sheaf {\\mathcal{F}}' on S' is equivalent to the data of the quasi-coherent sheaf \\alpha_*({\\mathcal{F}}') on S endowed with its {\\mathscr{A}}'-modules structure (noting that {\\mathscr{A}}'=\\alpha_*({\\mathscr{O}}_{S'})). For simplicity, we also denote this sheaf on S by {\\mathcal{F}}'. The two inverse images p_i^*({\\mathcal{F}}') of {\\mathcal{F}}' on S'\\times_S S' similarly correspond to the quasi-coherent sheaves of ({\\mathscr{A}}'\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}{\\mathscr{A}}')-modules {\\mathcal{F}}'\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}{\\mathscr{A}}' and {\\mathscr{A}}'\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}{\\mathcal{F}}'. The data of an (S'\\times_S S')-homomorphism from the former to the latter is equivalent to the data of a homomorphism of ({\\mathscr{A}}'\\otimes{\\mathscr{A}}')-modules, and, taking into account the fact that {\\mathscr{A}}' is locally free, this is equivalent to the data of a homomorphism of ({\\mathscr{A}}'\\otimes{\\mathscr{A}}')-modules: {\\mathscr{U}} = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}({\\mathscr{A}}',{\\mathscr{A}}') = {\\mathscr{A}}'\\otimes\\check{{\\mathscr{A}}}' \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}({\\mathcal{F}}',{\\mathcal{F}}') i.e. to the data, for every section \\xi of {\\mathscr{U}} over an open subset V, of a homomorphism of {\\mathscr{O}}_S-modules T_\\xi\\colon{\\mathcal{F}}'|V\\to{\\mathcal{F}}'|V that satisfies the conditions \\begin{aligned} T_{f\\xi}(x) &amp;= fT_\\xi(x), \\\\T_{\\xi f}(x) &amp;= T_\\xi(fx), \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.1} where f and x are (respectively) sections of {\\mathscr{A}}' and {\\mathcal{F}}' over an open subset of S that is contained inside V. Conditions (i) and (ii) of a descent data (cf. §A.1.c) can then be written (respectively) as T_{1_U}(x) = x, \\qquad\\text{i.e. }T_{1_U}=\\operatorname{id}_{{\\mathcal{F}}'} \\tag{3.2} T_{\\xi\\eta} = T_\\xi T_\\eta. \\tag{3.3} In other words, a descent data on {\\mathcal{F}}' is equivalent to a representation of the sheaf {\\mathscr{U}}=\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}({\\mathscr{A}}',{\\mathscr{A}}') of {\\mathscr{O}}_S-algebras in the sheaf \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}({\\mathcal{F}}',{\\mathcal{F}}') of {\\mathscr{O}}_S-algebras that satisfies the two linearity conditions (3.1). If we have a pairing of quasi-coherent sheaves on S': {\\mathcal{F}}'_1\\times{\\mathcal{F}}'_2 \\to {\\mathcal{F}}'_3 (that we can think of as a pairing of sheaves of {\\mathscr{A}}'-modules on S), and gluing data on the {\\mathcal{F}}'_i defined by homomorphisms T_i\\colon{\\mathscr{U}}\\to\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}({\\mathcal{F}}'_i,{\\mathcal{F}}'_i) (for i=1,2,3), then these data are equivalent to the given pairing, in the evident meaning of the phrase, if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every section \\xi of {\\mathscr{U}} over an open subset, and denoting by \\Delta\\xi=\\sum\\xi'_i\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{A}}'}\\xi''_i the section of {\\mathscr{U}}\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{A}}'}{\\mathscr{U}} (where {\\mathscr{U}} is considered as an {\\mathscr{A}}'-module with its left structure) defined by the formula \\xi\\cdot(fg) = \\sum_i\\xi'_i(f)\\xi''_i(g) (where f and g are sections of {\\mathscr{A}}' over a smaller open subset), we have the formula T_\\xi^{(3)}(x\\cdot y) = \\sum_i T_{\\xi'_i}^{(1)}x\\cdot T_{\\xi''_i}^{(2)}y \\tag{3.4} for every pair (x,y) of sections of {\\mathscr{A}}' over a smaller subset. (We can express this property by saying that the homomorphisms T^{(i)} are compatible with the diagonal map of {\\mathscr{U}}, with respect to the given pair). In particular, equations (3.1) to (3.4) allow us to understand, in terms of representations of algebras via diagonal maps, the descent data on a quasi-coherent sheaf of algebras on S', and thus also (by restricting to commutative algebras) the descent data on an affine S'-scheme. From here, we obtain an analogous interpretation of descent data on an arbitrary S'-prescheme X': the data of such an X' is equivalent to the data of a prescheme X' over S endowed with a homomorphism of {\\mathscr{O}}_S-algebras {\\mathscr{A}}'\\to{\\mathscr{O}}_{X'}, and a descent data on X' is equivalent to the data of a sheaf homomorphism {\\mathscr{U}} \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{h^{-1}({\\mathscr{O}}_S)}({\\mathscr{O}}_{X'},{\\mathscr{O}}_{X'}) that is compatible with the morphism h\\colon X'\\to S' and that satisfies the conditions analogous to equations (3.1) to (3.4) above. (Weil). Suppose that S'/S is a Galois étale covering with Galois group \\Gamma (cf.  and ). Then a descent data on a quasi-coherent sheaf {\\mathcal{F}}' on S' (resp. on an S'-prescheme X') is equivalent to the data of a representation of \\Gamma by automorphisms of (S',{\\mathcal{F}}') (resp. of (S',X')) that is compatible with the action of \\Gamma on S'. This result is “formal”, i.e. it can be proven in terms of categories, but, from the point of view of this section, we also obtain the explicit structure of {\\mathscr{U}} (endowed with its ring structure, the ring homomorphism {\\mathscr{A}}'\\to{\\mathscr{U}}, and the diagonal map), which is completely known thanks to the following result: {\\mathscr{U}} admits, as a left A'-module, a basis given by the sections of {\\mathscr{U}} that correspond to elements of \\Gamma. (Cartier). Let p be a prime number, and suppose that p{\\mathscr{O}}_S=0 (i.e. that {\\mathscr{O}}_S is of characteristic p), that ({\\mathscr{A}}')^p\\subset{\\mathscr{O}}_S={\\mathscr{A}} (i.e. that S'/S is radicial of height 1), and that the sheaf of algebras {\\mathscr{A}}' over {\\mathscr{A}} locally admits a p-basis (i.e. a family (x_i) of sections such that {\\mathscr{A}}' is generated as an algebra by the x_i under the sole condition that x_i^p=0). We suppose that the set of the i is finite, of cardinality n. Let {\\mathfrak{C}} be the sheaf of A-derivations of A', which is a locally free sheaf of rank n of A'-modules, and, furthermore, a sheaf of Lie p-algebras over {\\mathscr{A}} (but not over {\\mathscr{A}}') that satisfies the following condition: [X,fY] = X(f)Y + f[X,Y]. \\tag{3.5} {\\mathscr{U}}=\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}({\\mathscr{A}}',{\\mathscr{A}}') is generated, as an {\\mathscr{O}}_S-algebra endowed with an algebra homomorphism {\\mathscr{A}}'\\to{\\mathscr{U}}, by the sub-left-A'-module {\\mathfrak{C}}, with the following additional relations: \\begin{cases} Xf-fX &amp;= X(f) \\\\XY-YX &amp;= [X,Y] \\\\X^p &amp;= X^{(p)}. \\end{cases} \\tag{3.6} It follows from the above lemma that a descent data on the quasi-coherent sheaf {\\mathcal{F}}' on S' is equivalent to the data, for all X\\in{\\mathfrak{C}}, of an {\\mathscr{O}}_S-endomorphism \\overline{X} of {\\mathcal{F}}' that satisfies the following conditions: \\overline{fX} = f\\overline{X} \\tag{3.7} \\overline{X}(fx) = X(f)x + f\\overline{X}(x) \\tag{3.8} \\overline{[X,Y]} = [\\overline{X},\\overline{Y}] \\tag{3.9} \\overline{X^{(p)}} = \\overline{X}^p. \\tag{3.10} (This is what we may call a linear connection on {\\mathcal{F}}, which is further flat and compatible with the p-th powers). We can similarly write down the notion of a descent data on an S'-prescheme X', with equation (3.4) being replaced by the condition that the \\overline{X} are derivations of {\\mathscr{O}}_{X'}. Since the morphism S'\\to S is radicial, Theorem 3 ensures that every such descent data is effective, and thus defines an S-prescheme X. Note that we have not needed to impose any flatness, non-singular, or finiteness hypotheses on {\\mathcal{F}}' or X'. 3.8 Application to rationality criteria Let X be an S-prescheme such that the direct image of {\\mathscr{O}}_X on S is {\\mathscr{O}}_S; this property remains true for any flat base extension S'\\to S. If {\\mathcal{F}} is an invertible sheaf (i.e. locally free of rank 1) on X, then there is a bijective correspondence between automorphisms of {\\mathcal{F}} (identified with the invertible sections of {\\mathscr{O}}_X) and invertible sections of {\\mathscr{O}}_S. So let s be a section of X over S; we define a section of {\\mathcal{F}} over s to be a section of the invertible sheaf s^*({\\mathcal{F}}) on S. It follows from the above that, if {\\mathcal{F}}_i (for i=1,2) are invertible sheaves on X, each endowed with a section over s, and if {\\mathcal{F}}_1 and {\\mathcal{F}}_2 are isomorphic, then there exists exactly one isomorphism from {\\mathcal{F}}_1 to {\\mathcal{F}}_2 that is compatible with the sections in question (i.e. sending the first to the second). We also, independently of the section s, regard two invertible sheaves {\\mathcal{F}}_1 and {\\mathcal{F}}_2 on X as equivalent if every point of S has an open neighbourhood U such that the restrictions of {\\mathcal{F}}_1 and {\\mathcal{F}}_2 to X|U are isomorphic. Then every invertible sheaf {\\mathcal{F}} on X is equivalent to an invertible sheaf {\\mathcal{F}}_1 endowed with a marked section over s (we take {\\mathcal{F}}_1=Fs^*({\\mathcal{F}})^{-1}), and {\\mathcal{F}}_1 is determined up to isomorphism. In other words, the classification up to equivalence of invertible sheaves on X is the same as the classification up to isomorphism of invertible sheaves endowed with a marked section. Since these properties remain true under flat extensions \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S of the base (by replacing the section s with its inverse image s' under \\alpha), we thus conclude, taking Theorem 1 into account: With the prescheme X/S being as above, and admitting a section s, let \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S be a faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism; let {\\mathcal{F}}' be an invertible sheaf on X'=X\\times_S S'. For {\\mathcal{F}}' to be equivalent to the inverse image on X' of an invertible sheaf {\\mathcal{F}}' on X, it is necessary and sufficient for its inverse images p_1^*({\\mathcal{F}}') and p_2^*({\\mathcal{F}}') on X'\\times_X X'=X\\times_S(S'\\times_S S') to be equivalent. If this is the case, then {\\mathcal{F}} is determined up to equivalence. (We then say that {\\mathcal{F}}' is rational on S). Considering this principle in the case where \\alpha\\colon S'\\to S is as in Example 1 and Example 2 in the previous section, we recover the rationality criteria of Weil and of Cartier. (We note that the authors restrict to the case where S and S' are spectra of fields; a fortiori, S is then the spectrum of a local ring, and the equivalence relation introduced above is exactly the relation of being isomorphic). The the first case, {\\mathcal{F}}' is rational on S if and only if its images under \\Gamma are all equivalent to {\\mathcal{F}}'. To express the rationality criterion in the second case, we consider, more generally, the diagonal morphism X'\\to X''=X'\\times_X X' of X'/X, with the corresponding sheaf of ideals {\\mathscr{I}} on X'\\times_X X', and the sheaf {\\mathscr{I}}/{\\mathscr{I}}^2, which can be identified with its inverse image \\Omega_{X'/X}^1 on X (the sheaf of 1-differentials of X' with respect to X). Since the restrictions of the {\\mathcal{F}}''_i=p_i({\\mathcal{F}}') (for i=1,2) to the diagonal are isomorphic (since they are both isomorphic to {\\mathcal{F}}'), i.e. {\\mathcal{F}}''_1({\\mathcal{F}}''_2)^{-1}={\\mathcal{F}}'' has a restriction to the diagonal which is trivial, it follows that the restriction of {\\mathcal{F}}'' to (X'',{\\mathscr{O}}_{X''}/{\\mathscr{I}}^2) is given, up to isomorphism, by a well-defined element \\xi of \\operatorname{H}^1(X'',{\\mathscr{I}}/{\\mathscr{I}}^2) = \\operatorname{H}^1(X',\\Omega_{X'/X}^1). Also, being precise, we have \\Omega_{X'/X}^1=\\Omega_{S'/S}^1\\otimes_{{\\mathscr{O}}_S}{\\mathscr{O}}_X, and thus, if \\Omega_{S'/S}^1 is locally free on S (as in the Cartier case), then \\xi defines a section of \\operatorname{R}^1f'({\\mathscr{O}}_{X'})\\otimes\\Omega_{S'/S}^1 on S' (called the Atiyah–Cartier class of the invertible sheaf {\\mathcal{F}} on X'/S) whose vanishing is necessary and sufficient for the inverse images of {\\mathcal{F}}' under the two projections of (X'',{\\mathscr{O}}_{X''}/{\\mathscr{I}}^2) = X\\times_S(S'',{\\mathscr{O}}_{S''}/{\\mathscr{J}}^2) to X' to be equivalent (where {\\mathscr{J}} is the sheaf of ideals on S''=S'\\times_S S' defined by the diagonal morphism S'\\to S'\\times_S S'). This vanishing is thus trivially necessary for the inverse images of {\\mathcal{F}}' on X''=X\\times_S S'' itself to be equivalent, and thus also for {\\mathcal{F}} to be equivalent to the inverse image of an invertible sheaf {\\mathcal{F}} on X. The Atiyah–Cartier class can also be understood as the obstruction to the existence, locally over S', of a connection of {\\mathcal{F}}' relative to the derivations of X'/X, with such a connection further being determined when we know the derivations of {\\mathcal{F}}' corresponding to the natural extensions of derivations of S'/S to X'. From this, and the results of the previous section, we easily conclude that, in the case of the aforementioned Example 2, and when X/S admits a section, the vanishing of the Atiyah–Cartier class is also sufficient for {\\mathcal{F}}' to be rational on S. 3.9 Application to the restriction of the base scheme to an abelian scheme Let S be a prescheme. Well define an abelian scheme over S to be a simple proper scheme X over S whose fibres at the points x\\in S are schemes of abelian varieties over the \\mathfrak{K}(x). Suppose that S is Noetherian and regular (i.e. that its local rings are regular), then we can show, using the connection theorem of Murre [20] (at least in the case “of equal characteristics”, where the cited theorem is currently proven) that every rational section of X over S is everywhere defined (i.e. is a section) (which generalises a classical theorem of Weil). It then follows, more generally, that, if X' is a simple scheme over S, then every rational S-map from X' to X is everywhere defined. From this, we obtain the following, which generalises a result of Chow–Lang: with S Noetherian and regular, and K denoting its ring of rational functions (a direct sum of fields), let X be an abelian scheme over K; if X is isomorphic to a K-scheme of the form X_0\\times_S\\operatorname{Spec}(K), where X_0 is an abelian scheme over S, then X_0 is determined up to unique isomorphism. Using the above uniqueness result, we see that the question of restriction of the base to X is local on S (and thus that it suffices to know how to do the restriction to \\operatorname{Spec}({\\mathscr{O}}_x), where x\\in S). In the same way, we see that, if S'\\to S is a simple morphism of finite type, if Y' is the ring of rational functions of S', and if X\\otimes_K K' is of the form X'_0\\times_{S'}\\operatorname{Spec}(K'), then X'_0 is endowed with a canonical descent data with respect to \\alpha. Taking Theorem 3 into account, we thus conclude: Let S be an irreducible regular Noetherian prescheme, with field of rational functions Y, let K' be a finite extension of K that is unramified over S, let S' be the normalisation of S in K' (which is thus an étale cover of S), and let X be an abelian scheme over K such that X\\otimes_K K' is of the form X'_0\\times_{S'}\\operatorname{Spec}(K'), where X'_0 is a projective abelian scheme over S'. Then X is of the form X_0\\times_S\\operatorname{Spec}(K), where X_0 is a projective abelian scheme over S. The speaker does not know if we can replace the hypothesis that S'\\to S be a surjective étale cover (which allows us to apply Theorem 3) with the hypothesis that it is instead a simple and surjective morphism of finite type (not even if we suppose that it is an étalement), or if the proposition still holds true without supposing that X'_0 is projective over S' (a condition which could be automatically satisfied). 3.10 Application to local triviality and isotriviality criteria Let S be a prescheme, G a “prescheme of groups” over S, P a prescheme over S on which “G acts” (on the right). We say that P is formally principal homogeneous under G if the well-known morphism G\\times_S P \\to P\\times_S P (induced from the actions of G on P) is an isomorphism. From now on, we assume G to be flat over S (and thus faithfully flat over S), and we reserve the name of principal homogeneous bundle under G for a formally principal homogeneous bundle P that is faithfully flat and quasi-compact over S. It is immediate that this is equivalent to being able to find a faithfully flat and quasi-compact extension S'\\to S of the base S such that the formally principal homogeneous bundle P'=P\\times_S S' under G'=G\\times_S S' is trivial, i.e. isomorphic to G' (i.e. admitting a section); we can take, in particular, S'=P. Note also that, if S is locally Noetherian, then the faithfully-flat hypothesis on P is equivalent to the hypothesis that \\overline{P}_S=P\\times_S\\operatorname{Spec}(\\overline{{\\mathscr{O}}}_s) be faithfully flat over \\overline{{\\mathscr{O}}}_s for all s\\in S (where \\overline{{\\mathscr{O}}}_s denotes the completion of the local ring {\\mathscr{O}}_s), as follows from the fact that \\overline{{\\mathscr{O}}}_s is faithfully flat over {\\mathscr{O}}_s. Also, if P is of finite type over S, and S is locally Noetherian, then the set of points s satisfying the above condition is constructible, and so, if S is a “Jacobson prescheme” (for example, a scheme of finite type over a field, or, more generally, over a Jacobson ring), then it suffices to verify the condition in question for the closed points of S. This leads us to the case where the base is the spectrum of a complete local ring A. If S=\\operatorname{Spec}(A) (with A a complete Noetherian local ring), and if P is of finite type over S, then the faithful flatness of P/S is also equivalent to the existence of an S' that is finite and flat over S such that P' is trivial, and, if, further, G is simple over S, then we can suppose S' to be étale over S. Then, if, further, the residue field of A is algebraically closed (the “geometric case”), then P is faithfully flat over A if and only if it is trivial. Thus, if S is an algebraic prescheme over an algebraically closed field, and if G is simple and of finite type over S, then we see that the faithfully-flat condition on S is equivalent to the condition of being analytically trivial (SLF) of Serre [25]. We can consider other, stronger, types of conditions on P, that have a “local triviality” nature. In particular, we say that P is isotrivial (resp. strictly isotrivial) if, for all s\\in S, there exists an open neighbourhood U of S, and a finite and faithfully flat morphism (resp. a surjective étale covering) U'\\to U such that P'=P\\times_S U' is trivial. (We stray from the terminology of Serre [4], which uses “locally isotrivial” for what we call “strictly isotrivial”). Strict isotriviality is mainly useful if G is simple over S, but is, however, an inadequate notion in other cases. If G is affine over S, then every principal homogeneous bundle P under G is affine, by §B.2, whence the possibility, thanks to Theorem 2, to “descend” from such bundles by faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphisms. Taking, in particular, G=\\operatorname{GL}(n)_S, defined by the condition that the functor S'\\mapsto\\operatorname{Hom}(S',G) of S-preschemes (with values in the category of groups) can be identified with the functor \\operatorname{GL}(n)(S')=\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\operatorname{H}^0(S',{\\mathscr{O}}_{S'})) described in . Using the facts that every principal homogeneous bundle under G (resp. every locally free sheaf of rank n on S) becomes isomorphic to the “trivial” object G (resp. {\\mathscr{O}}_S^n) under a suitable faithfully flat and quasi-compact extension of S; that we can descend the type of objects in question (principal homogeneous bundles under G, resp. locally free sheaves of rank n) by such morphisms; and, finally that the automorphism group of the trivial bundle on any S'/S is functorially isomorphic to the automorphism group of the trivial locally free sheaf of rank n on S', we “formally” conclude that it is “equivalent” to give, on S (or on some S'/S) a principal homogeneous bundle of group G, or to give a locally free sheaf of rank n. (More precisely, we have an equivalence of fibred categories). We thus conclude, in particular: Every principal homogeneous bundle under the group \\operatorname{GL}(n)_S is locally trivial. By known arguments, we thus conclude the same result for others structure groups such as \\operatorname{SL}(n)_S, \\operatorname{Sp}(n)_S, and products of such groups. We thus also conclude that, if F is a closed subgroup of G=\\operatorname{GL}(n)_S that is flat over S, and such that the quotient G/F exists, and such that G is an isotrivial (resp. strictly isotrivial) principal homogeneous bundle on G/F, of structure group F\\times_S(G/F), then every principal homogeneous bundle of structure group F is isotrivial (resp. strictly isotrivial). This applies to all the “linear groups” on S that have been used up until now, and, in particular, to the case where G=S\\times_k\\Gamma, with S a prescheme over the field k, and \\Gamma a linear group (in the classical sense) over k (and thus in particular simple). This thus answers, for such groups, a question of Serre (loc. cit.). We also point out that, for most groups (linear or not) that are simple over S that we know of, and certainly for all those of the form S\\times_k\\Gamma as above, we can show that every isotrivial principal homogeneous bundle is strictly isotrivial, which answers, in particular, another question of Serre (loc. cit. 1–14), taking into account the fact that a homogeneous principal bundle obtained by a descent à la Cartier (cf.Example 2) is obviously isotrivial. One of the essential difficulties in these questions (setting aside the question of the existence of quotient schemes) is the lack of effectiveness criteria for a descent data along a faithfully flat non-finite morphism.

TO-DO: additif errata Introduction The techniques described in [10] were, for the most part, independent of any projective hypotheses on the schemes in question. Unfortunately, they have not as of yet allowed us to solve the existence problems posed in [10]. In the current exposé, and the following, we will solve these problems by imposing projective hypotheses. The techniques used are typically projective, and practically make no use of any results from [10]. Here we will construct “Hilbert schemes”, which are meant to replace the use of Chow coordinates, as was mentioned in [10]. In the next exposé, the theory of passing to the quotient in schemes, developed in [10], combined with the theory of Hilbert schemes, will allow us, for example, to construct Picard schemes (defined in [10]) under rather general conditions. In summary, we can say that we now have a more or less satisfying technique of projective constructions, apart from the fact that we are still missing9 a theory of passing to the quotient by groups such as the projective group, acting “without fixed points” (cf. [10]). The situation even seems slightly better in analytic geometry (if we restrict to the study of “projective” analytic spaces over a given analytic space), since, for analytic spaces, the difficulty of passing to the quotient by a group that acts nicely disappears. Either way, in algebraic geometry, as well as in analytic geometry, it remains to develop a construction technique that works without any projective hypotheses. 6.1 Bounded sets of sheaves: invariance properties Let k be a field, and X a k-prescheme (which we take to be of finite type, for simplicity). For every extension K/k, we obtain a K-prescheme X_K=X\\otimes_k K. If {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent sheaf on X_K, and if K' is an extension of K, then {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes_K K'={\\mathscr{F}}_{K'} is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X_K\\otimes_KK'=X_{K'}. So, if K and K' are arbitrary extensions of k, and {\\mathscr{F}} a quasi-coherent sheaf on X_K and {\\mathscr{F}}' a quasi-coherent sheaf on X_{K'}, then we say that {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{F}}' are equivalent if there exists an extension K''/k as well as k-homomorphisms K\\to K'' and K'\\to K'' such that {\\mathscr{F}}_{K''} and {\\mathscr{F}}'_{K''} are isomorphic on X_{K''} (TO-DO: ? is this right?). This defines an equivalence relation, and we are interested in the equivalence classes of sheaves under this relation, and of sets of such equivalence classes. Note that, if X_0 is of finite type over k, then every class of coherent sheaves can be defined by a coherent sheaf on X_K, where K is some extension of k of finite type. We can thus, in the definition of classes of coherent sheaves, restrict ourselves to algebraically closed extensions of k, and we can also restrict ourselves to a fixed algebraically closed extension \\Omega of k, of infinite transcendence degree; two coherent sheaves {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{F}}' on X_\\Omega are then equivalent if and only if there exists a K-automorphism \\sigma of \\Omega such that {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes_K(\\Omega,\\sigma) is isomorphic to {\\mathscr{F}}'. Note that there is a bijective correspondence between classes of coherent sheaves under the first definition and under the second. Let E and E' be two sets of classes of coherent sheaves on X. Consider the classes of all sheaves of the form {\\mathscr{F}}\\otimes{\\mathscr{F}}', where {\\mathscr{F}} and {\\mathscr{F}}' are coherent sheaves on the same X_K, with the class of {\\mathscr{F}} being in E and the class of {\\mathscr{F}}' being in E'. We thus define a set of classes of coherent sheaves that we denote by E\\otimes E'. We can similarly define \\underline{\\operatorname{Tor}}_i(E,E'), etc. References "],["FGA-3-V.html", "7 Picard schemes: Existence theorems [FGA 3.V]", " 7 Picard schemes: Existence theorems [FGA 3.V] Grothendieck, A. “Technique de descente et théorèmes d’existence en géométrie algébrique, V: Les schémas de Picard: Théorèmes d’existence”.
