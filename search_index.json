[["index.html", "Foundations of Algebraic Geometry Foreword", " Foundations of Algebraic Geometry A. Grothendieck 1957–1962 !! TO-DO: translator’s note !! Version: GIT_COMMIT_HASH_VARIABLE Foreword In the Séminaire Bourbaki, between 1957 and 1962, we gave eight exposés on the foundations of algebraic geometry. With the exception of the first, these exposés are expressed in the language of schemes. All of the stated results will find their place in Jean Dieudonné and Alexander Grothendieck’s “Éléments de géométrie algébrique”. However, none of the essence of any of these exposés is currently found in any of the chapters (neither published nor still in preperation) of the EGA, nor in any other book or article, and this will probably remain the case for a few more years still. This is the main reason that persuaded us to combine these exposés, giving readers access to a number of ideas and key results of the theory of schemes whilst awaiting a well-written summary. Also, reading these chapters will allow the reader to quickly familiarise themselves with the aforementioned results and ideas, without being bothered by the necessarily cumbersome details of a systematic treatment, and also endow them with vital motivations for the study of such a treatment. For the sake of the reader, we have assembled here some comments and errata, grouped by exposé, that, most notably, show the progress accomplished since the editing of this text, as well as indicating some supplementary references.1 Many of the results appearing in these exposés have been discussed in detail in the Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie, as well as in the two subsequent seminars at Harvard, in 1961–62 (the first by myself, and the second by Mumford–Tate), the notes for which are currently in preparation by Lichtenbaum. [Trans.] Rather than translating the comments and errata here, we have inserted them throughout the text in the relevant places; we preface them with “[Comp.]” (except for small corrections, which we insert silently).↩︎ "],["FGA-1.html", "1 — Duality theorems for coherent algebraic sheaves 1. \\operatorname{Ext} of sheaves of modules 2.

Séminaire Bourbaki 9 (1956–57), Talk no. 149. The results that follow, inspired by Serre’s “theorem of algebraic duality”, were discovered in the winter of 1955 and the winter of 1956. They can be established very simply, thanks to reasonably elementary results on the cohomology of projective spaces [21] and an intensive use of Cartan–Eilenberg’s homological algebra, in the form given in [7]. 1. \\operatorname{Ext} of sheaves of modules (cf. [7], chap. 3 and 4) Let X be a topological space endowed with a sheaf {\\mathscr{O}} of unital (but not necessarily commutative) rings. We consider the abelian category {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} of sheaves of {\\mathscr{O}}-modules, which are also referred to as {\\mathscr{O}}-modules. We know that every object of this category admits an injective resolution, which allows us to define the \\operatorname{Ext} functors that have the well-known formal properties. More precisely, to avoid confusion, we denote by \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}), or simply \\operatorname{Hom}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}), the abelian groups of {\\mathscr{O}}-homomorphisms from {\\mathscr{A}} to {\\mathscr{B}}, whereas \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) denotes the sheaf of germs of homomorphisms from {\\mathscr{A}} to {\\mathscr{B}} (where {\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}\\in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}). We define, for fixed {\\mathscr{A}}\\in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}, functors h_{\\mathscr{A}} and \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}, with values in the category {\\mathcal{C}} of abelian groups and the category {\\mathcal{C}}^Z of abelian sheaves on X (respectively), by the formulas: \\begin{aligned} h_{\\mathscr{A}}({\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\\\\\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}({\\mathscr{B}}) &amp;= \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}). \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1} The functors h_{\\mathscr{A}} and \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}} are left exact and covariant, and so we consider their right-derived functors, denoted by \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) and \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) (respectively). We then have, by definition, \\begin{gathered} \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p h_{\\mathscr{A}})({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}}))) \\\\\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}})({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}}))) \\end{gathered} \\tag{1.2} where \\operatorname{R}^p denotes the passage to right-derived functors, and where C({\\mathscr{B}}) denotes an arbitrary injective resolution of {\\mathscr{B}} in {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}}. We denote by \\Gamma\\colon{\\mathcal{C}}^Z\\to{\\mathcal{C}} the “sections” functor; recall that its right-derived functors are denoted by B\\mapsto\\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}): \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}) = (\\operatorname{R}^p\\Gamma)({\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(\\Gamma(C({\\mathscr{B}}))). \\tag{1.3} We evidently have h_{\\mathscr{A}}=\\Gamma\\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}}; we can also show that \\underline{h}_{\\mathscr{A}} sends injective objects to \\Gamma-acyclic objects. From this, it is a well-known result that: For every {\\mathscr{O}}-module {\\mathscr{A}}, there exists a cohomological spectral functor on {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} that abuts to the graded functor (\\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^\\bullet(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})), and whose initial page is E_2^{p,q}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})). \\tag{1.4} From this, we obtain “boundary homomorphisms”, as well as a short exact sequence, which we will not write. If {\\mathscr{A}} is locally isomorphic to {\\mathscr{O}}^n, then we have canonical isomorphisms \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\xleftarrow{\\sim} \\operatorname{H}^p(x,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\tag{1.5} (given by the boundary homomorphisms of the spectral sequence). In particular, we have a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{O}},{\\mathscr{B}}) = \\operatorname{H}^p(X,{\\mathscr{B}}). \\tag{1.6} To use these results, we need to know how to explicitly describe the \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}). They are functors that we calculate locally, i.e. if V is an open subset of X, then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})|U = \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}|U}^p({\\mathscr{A}}|U,{\\mathscr{B}}|U), as follows from the fact that the restriction to U of an injective {\\mathscr{O}}-module is an injective ({\\mathscr{O}}|U)-module. Furthermore, for fixed x\\in X, we have functorial homomorphisms \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})_x \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_x}({\\mathscr{A}}_x,{\\mathscr{B}}_x) \\tag{1.7} that uniquely extend to homomorphisms of cohomological functors (in {\\mathscr{B}}): \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})_x \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_x}^p({\\mathscr{A}}_x,{\\mathscr{B}}_x). \\tag{1.8} If {\\mathscr{A}} is isomorphic, in a neighbourhood of x, to the cokernel of some homomorphism {\\mathscr{O}}^m\\to{\\mathscr{O}}^n, then (1.7) is an isomorphism for all p. This is the case, in particular, if {\\mathscr{A}} is a coherent {\\mathscr{O}}-module [21]. Let {\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet=({\\mathscr{L}}_i) be a left resolution of the {\\mathscr{O}}-module {\\mathscr{A}} by {\\mathscr{O}}-modules that are all locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{O}}^n. Then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) can be identified with \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}})), and \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) can be identified with the hypercohomology of X with respect to the complex \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}}). Proof. The proof is standard: we consider the bicomplex \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,C({\\mathscr{B}})), where C({\\mathscr{B}}) is an injective resolution of {\\mathscr{B}}, as well as the natural homomorphisms into this bicomplex from \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{L}}_\\bullet,{\\mathscr{B}}) and \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},C({\\mathscr{B}})). } To finish, we note that the two \\operatorname{Ext} functors introduced in (1.2) are not only cohomological functors in {\\mathscr{B}}, but in fact cohomological bifunctors, covariant in {\\mathscr{B}}, and contravariant in {\\mathscr{A}}. 2. The composition law in \\operatorname{Ext} The results of this section are due, independently, to Cartier and Yoneda; see a talk by Cartier [2] for more details. Let {\\mathcal{C}} be an abelian category, and let K and L be two graded objects of {\\mathcal{C}}. We denote by \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L) the graded abelian group whose degree-n component consists of homogeneous homomorphisms of degree n from K to L (i.e. systems (u_i) of homomorphisms K^i\\to L^{i+n}). If K and L are complexes (with differentials of degree +1, to fix conventions), then we endow \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L) with the differential operator given by \\delta(u) = \\mathrm{d}u + (-1)^{n+1}u\\mathrm{d} \\quad\\text{where }n=\\deg(u) \\tag{2.1} which makes it a complex with a differential of degree +1. The cycles of degree n are the maps of degree n that anticommute with u (as homogeneous maps). We can then consider \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(K,L)), which is an invariant of the homotopy types of K and L, and which we sometimes denote by \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L). If we have a third complex M, then the composition of homomorphisms defines a pairing \\operatorname{Hom}(K,L)\\times\\operatorname{Hom}(L,M)\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(K,M) which is compatible with the differential maps, whence, by passing to the cohomology of pairings, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L)\\times\\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(L,M) \\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,M) \\tag{2.2} which we write as (u,v)\\mapsto vu. These pairings satisfy an evident associativity property; in particular, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,K) is an associative graded unital ring, and \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(K,L) (resp. \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(L,K)) is a graded right (resp. left) module over this ring, etc. In dimension 0, (2.2) reduces to the composition of permissible homomorphisms of complexes. Finally, an exact sequence of complexes 0\\to K'\\to K\\to K''\\to0 such that, for all i, K'^i can be identified with a direct factor of K^i, gives rise to an exact sequence of complexes of groups \\operatorname{Hom}(K'',L), etc., whence a coboundary map \\operatorname{H}^i(K',L)\\to\\operatorname{H}^{i+1}(K'',L). We similarly define the boundary maps relative to an exact sequence in L. The pairings in (2.2) are compatible, in the usual sense, with these coboundary maps. Now suppose that {\\mathcal{C}} is a category such that every element A of {\\mathcal{C}} admits an injective resolution C(A). We then note that, using one of the many variants of the theorem of bicomplexes, \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(C(A),C(B)) = \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(C(A),C(B))) is canonically isomorphic to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}(A,C(B))) = \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,B). The coboundary maps described above give coboundary maps of the \\operatorname{Ext}. Furthermore, the pairings in (2.2) give associative pairings here: \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,B)\\times\\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(B,C) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,C) \\tag{2.3} and these are compatible with the coboundary maps. In particular, \\operatorname{Ext}^\\bullet(A,A) is an associative graded unital ring, etc. (We can show in an analogous manner that the \\operatorname{Ext} functors behave like derived functors of an arbitrary functor; we do not make use of this fact here). In the case where the category in question is the category {\\mathcal{C}}^{\\mathscr{O}} of {\\mathscr{O}}-modules on X, we then obtain pairings \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})\\times\\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q(X;{\\mathscr{B}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^{p+q}(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\tag{2.4} that can be calculated as already described. The same method, but replacing the category of abelian groups with the category of abelian sheaves on X, and the \\operatorname{Hom} functors by the \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}} functors, again defines pairings, having the same formal properties, and of a “local nature” this time: \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^p({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})\\times\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^q({\\mathscr{B}},{\\mathscr{C}}) \\to \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^{p+q}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{C}}). \\tag{2.5} These can be understood by noting that the homomorphisms in (1.8) are compatible with the pairings between the \\operatorname{Ext}. Finally, recall that we also have a multiplicative structure between functors \\operatorname{H}^p(X,A), namely the cup product. We note then that the spectral sequences of Proposition 1 are compatible with the multiplicative structures; more precisely, we have a pairing from the spectral sequence E(A,B) with the spectral sequence E(B,C) to the spectral sequence E(A,C) that abuts to the pairing between the global \\operatorname{Ext}, and whose initial page comes from the cup product and the local \\operatorname{Ext} pairings in the right-hand side of (1.4). It then follows, in particular, that the “boundary homomorphisms” \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^0(X;\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\tag{2.6} \\operatorname{H}^n(X,\\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathscr{O}}({\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}})) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}_{\\mathscr{O}}^n(X;{\\mathscr{A}},{\\mathscr{B}}) \\tag{2.7} are compatible with the multiplicative structures. So, if we restrict to sheaves that are locally isomorphic to some {\\mathscr{O}}^m, then this completely explains the composition of the global \\operatorname{Ext} by means of the cup product, taking into account the isomorphisms of (1.5). 3. Results concerning local cohomology Let A be a unital commutative ring endowed with an ideal {\\mathfrak{J}}. We will define, for any A-module M, functorial homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{Hom}_A(\\wedge^p{\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2,M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) \\\\\\operatorname{Tor}_p^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\leftarrow(\\wedge^p{\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2)\\otimes\\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.1} where the tensor and exterior products are taken over the ring A; note also that {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2 is in fact an A/{\\mathfrak{J}}-module, and that its exterior powers as an A-module agree with its exterior powers as an A/{\\mathfrak{J}}-module. The definition of the homomorphisms in (3.1) come from the definition, for every system x=(x_1,\\ldots,x_p) of points of {\\mathfrak{J}}, of homomorphisms \\varphi_x given by \\begin{aligned} \\varphi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}} \\\\\\varphi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{Tor}_p^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.2} such that the following conditions are satisfied: \\varphi_{x_1,\\ldots,x_p} depends on the system of the x_i\\in{\\mathfrak{J}} in an alternating A-multilinear way; \\varphi_{x_1,\\ldots,x_p} is zero when any of the x_i is in {\\mathfrak{J}}^2. In fact, ii. follows from i., since a\\varphi_x=0 for a\\in{\\mathfrak{J}}, as we see by noting that all the modules in (3.2) are annihilated by {\\mathfrak{J}}. To define the \\varphi_x, we consider the complex K_x whose underlying A-modules are the \\wedge A^p, and whose differential is the interior product i_x by x, considered as a linear form on A^p with components x_1,\\ldots,x_p. The differential is of degree -1, the degrees of the complex are positive, and the cohomology of this complex in dimension 0 is A/(x_1A+\\ldots+x_pA). Since the x_i are in {\\mathfrak{J}}, we obtain an augmentation K_{x,0}\\to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. Thus K_x is a free augmented complex, with augmentation module A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. We thus obtain known homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Ext}_A^\\bullet(\\operatorname{H}_0(K_x),M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) \\\\\\operatorname{Tor}_\\bullet^A(\\operatorname{H}_0(K_x),M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{H}_\\bullet(K_x\\otimes M) \\end{aligned} whence, by composing with the homomorphisms to the \\operatorname{Ext} and the \\operatorname{Tor} induced by the augmentation homomorphism \\operatorname{H}_0(K_x)\\to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, we obtain homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\psi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Ext}_A^\\bullet(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\to \\operatorname{H}^\\bullet(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) \\\\\\psi_x\\colon \\operatorname{Tor}_\\bullet^A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{H}_\\bullet(K_x\\otimes M). \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.3} But we immediately note that, in the maximal dimension p, the cohomology of the right-hand side is M(x_1M+\\ldots+x_pM) (resp. the set of elements of M that are annihilated by each of the x_i). Since the x_i are in {\\mathfrak{J}}, we thus obtain homomorphisms \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{H}^p(\\operatorname{Hom}_A(K_x,M)) &amp;\\to M\\otimes A/{\\mathfrak{J}} \\\\\\operatorname{H}_p(K_x\\otimes M) &amp;\\leftarrow\\operatorname{Hom}_A(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},M). \\end{aligned} \\tag{3.4} By composing the homomorphisms in (3.3) and (3.4) we obtain the homomorphisms in (3.2) that we wanted to define. The verification of i. is tedious, but does not present any difficulties. Let A be a commutative unital ring, and let (x_1,\\ldots,x_p) be a sequence of elements of A such that, for 1\\leqslant i\\leqslant p, the image of x_i in the quotient of A by the ideal generated by (x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1}) is not a zero divisor. Let {\\mathfrak{J}} be the ideal generated by the x_i. Then {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2 is a free (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module, with basis given by the canonical images of the x_i; the complex K_x is a free resolution of A/{\\mathfrak{J}}; and, for every A-modules M, the homomorphisms in (3.1) in dimension p are bijective. The same is true for the analogous homomorphisms defined for arbitrary degree i as long as {\\mathfrak{J}}\\cdot M=0. (The essential point, from which all others follow, is the acyclicity of K_x, which is a well-known fact, under the conditions given). With A and {\\mathfrak{J}} as above, suppose further that A is a regular affine algebra of \\dim n over a perfect field k, and that A/{\\mathfrak{J}} is a regular affine algebra. Denote by \\Omega^i(A) and \\Omega^i(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) the modules of Kähler differentials. Then we have a canonical isomorphism \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(\\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}),\\Omega^n(A)) = A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. \\tag{3.5} which is compatible with localisation. Proof. Indeed, \\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}) is a free (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module of rank 1, and, similarly, \\Omega^n(A) is a free A-module of rank n, and so the left-hand side is equal to \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},A) \\otimes \\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}})' \\otimes \\Omega^n(A) (where the “'” notation denotes the dual (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-module). The tensor product of these last two factors can be identified with \\wedge^p({\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2), and so the whole thing can be identified with \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},\\wedge^p({\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2)), and thus, by the proposition, with \\operatorname{Hom}_A(\\wedge^p {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2,\\wedge^p {\\mathfrak{J}}/{\\mathfrak{J}}^2) i.e. to A/{\\mathfrak{J}}. In particular, there is a distinguished element in \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(\\Omega^{n-p}(A/{\\mathfrak{J}}),\\Omega^n(A)), corresponding to the unit of A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, called the fundamental class of the ideal {\\mathfrak{J}} in A. (In fact, it can be defined under rather more general conditions). We can write Corollary 1 in a more geometric and global form: Let X be a non-singular variety over an algebraically-closed field k, Y a closed non-singular subvariety of X, {\\mathscr{O}}_X the structure sheaf of X, and {\\mathscr{O}}_Y the structure sheaf of Y, considered as a quotient sheaf of {\\mathscr{O}}_X. Let n be the dimension of X, and n-p the dimension of Y. Let \\Omega_X (resp. \\Omega_Y) be the sheaf of germs of regular differential forms on X (resp. Y). Then we have canonical isomorphisms \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p(\\Omega_Y^{n-p},\\Omega_X^n) = {\\mathscr{O}}_Y \\tag{3.6} as well as \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^n) = \\Omega_Y^{n-p}. \\tag{3.6 bis} Equation (3.6 bis) can serve as the definition of \\Omega_Y^{n-p} when Y is a singular variety. More precisely: Let X be a non-singular algebraic variety of dimension n, and let Y be an algebraic subset of dimension q=n-p of X. Let {\\mathscr{F}} be a coherent algebraic sheaf on X with support contained in Y, and let {\\mathscr{L}} be a locally-free algebraic sheaf on X. Then the sheaves \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^i({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) are zero for i&lt;p, and, when i=p, there is a canonical isomorphism \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_X/{\\mathfrak{J}},{\\mathscr{L}})) \\tag{3.7} where {\\mathfrak{J}} denotes an arbitrary sheaf of ideals on X that annihilates {\\mathscr{F}} and has Y as its set of zeros. In particular, if {\\mathscr{F}} is a coherent algebraic sheaf on Y, then \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},{\\mathscr{L}}) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_Y}({\\mathscr{F}},\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,{\\mathscr{L}})). \\tag{3.7 bis} Finally, with {\\mathscr{F}} still a coherent algebraic sheaf on Y, the sheaves {\\mathscr{E}}^i=\\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^{p+i}({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) do not depend on the choice of immersion of the algebraic space Y into the non-singular algebraic variety X. Proof. Since the question is local, we can assume that X is affine and that {\\mathscr{L}}={\\mathscr{O}}_X. This then reduces to a problem of commutative algebra, and, more specifically, of local algebra: if A is a regular locality, and M an A-module whose support is of dimension \\leqslant q=n-p, then we have to prove that \\operatorname{Ext}_A^i(M,A)=0 for i&lt;p and that \\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(M,A)=\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M,\\operatorname{Ext}^p(A/{\\mathfrak{J}},A)), where {\\mathfrak{J}} is an arbitrary ideal of “dimension” \\leqslant q that annihilates M. For the first claim, we proceed by induction on q: an immediate dévissage leads to the case where M is of the form A/{\\mathfrak{J}}, and thus leads, by replacing {\\mathfrak{J}} with a smaller ideal and using the induction hypothesis, as well as the exact sequence of the \\operatorname{Ext}, to the case where {\\mathfrak{J}} is generated by a “system of parameters”, as in Proposition 4, where the result is immediate. The previous result implies that, if {\\mathfrak{J}} is a fixed ideal of “dimension” \\leqslant q, then the contravariant functor E(M)=\\operatorname{Ext}_A^p(M,A) to the category of (A/{\\mathfrak{J}})-modules is left exact; furthermore, it sends direct sums to direct products, from which it easily follows that E(M)=\\operatorname{Hom}_A(M,E(A)). Finally, the last claim of Proposition 5 is more subtle, and follows from an intrinsic characterisation of the E^i(F) via a local duality theorem which cannot be stated here. Denote by \\omega_Y^q the sheaf \\operatorname{Ext}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{O}}_Y,\\Omega_X^n). Then there is a functorial isomorphism for coherent algebraic sheaves {\\mathscr{F}} on Y: \\underline{\\operatorname{Ext}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}^p({\\mathscr{F}},\\Omega_X^n) = \\underline{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathscr{O}}_X}({\\mathscr{F}},\\omega_Y^q). \\tag{3.8} 4. Cohomology class associated to a subvariety In all that follows, X denotes an algebraic set of dimension n, defined over a field k that we assume, for simplicity, to be algebraically closed. Except for in §6, we assume that X is non-singular. We denote by {\\mathscr{O}}_X the structure sheaf of X, and by \\Omega_X^\\bullet=\\bigcup_p\\Omega_X^p the sheaf of germs of differential forms on X. If Y is a closed subset of X, then we identify coherent algebraic sheaves on Y with coherent algebraic sheaves on X that are zero outside of Y; we do this, in particular, with {\\mathscr{O}}_Y and \\Omega_Y.
